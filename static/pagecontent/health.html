    Combat and Hazards inflict <strong>HARM</strong> on a character.
</p>
<!-- this doesn't actually explain how Consequences work or how major Consequences get worse, etc.-->
<p>
    If <strong>HARM</strong> isn't absorbed by the target character spending <strong>GRIT</strong> it inflicts a
    <strong>CONSEQUENCE</strong> on said character (<strong>CONSEQUENCES</strong> have both a role play and a mechanical
    effect).
</p>

<p>
    Too many untreated consequences (4 as standard) and you <strong>DIE</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    When you have received a critical consequence and are deteriorating towards terminal, every additional harm you
    receive (remember if you have GRIT left you can still soak regular harm) will reduce your deterioration time by 10
    minutes to a minimum of 10 minutes.
</p>
<p>
    In the event you are critical and are lucky enough to have been stabilised, the next point of harm will restart your
    count and then subsequent harm will reduce your time as above.

    <strong>GRIEVOUS HARM</strong> is a form of <strong>HARM</strong> of such severity and intensity that a baseline
    human cannot hope to shrug it off - things like taking a bullet to the face, or a chainsaw to the gut.
    <strong>GRIEVOUS HARM</strong> cannot be absorbed by spending <strong>GRIT</strong> and automatically inflicts a
    <strong>CONSEQUENCE</strong> on its victim.
