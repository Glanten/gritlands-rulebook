    Combat and Hazards inflict <strong>HARM</strong> on a character.
</p>

<p>
    If <strong>HARM</strong> isn't absorbed by the target character spending <strong>GRIT</strong> it inflicts a
    <strong>CONSEQUENCE</strong> on said character
    (<strong>CONSEQUENCES</strong> have both a role play and a mechanical effect).
</p>

<p>
    Too many untreated consequences (4 as standard) and you <strong>DIE</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>GRIEVOUS HARM</strong> is a form of <strong>HARM</strong> of such severity and intensity that a baseline
    human cannot hope to shrug it off -
    things like taking a bullet to the face, or a chainsaw to the gut. <strong>GRIEVOUS HARM</strong> cannot be absorbed
    by spending <strong>GRIT</strong>
    and automatically inflicts a <strong>CONSEQUENCE</strong> on its victim.
