<h1>Introduction and Overview</h1>
<p>Welcome, Scavenger, to the Beta version of the Gritlands LARP game mechanics.</p>
<p>
    This release focuses on Character Creation and provides just enough supporting material to support players making
    educated guesses about the characters they will be portraying in the game. Much of the content that is included is
    still under review. If you want to provide feedback on these rules we'd appreciate it - please send us an email at
    <a href="mailto:feedback@gritlands.co.uk">feedback@gritlands.co.uk</a>!

    <strong>Specifically, this document will explain:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>How to create your character</li>
        <li>How we measure the health (or otherwise) of your character</li>
        <li>The abilities and equipment your character can use - in combat and out of it</li>
        <li>How you can interact with the game world in order to discover information, defend yourself, overcome
            obstacles
            and solve problems</li>
    </ul>
    We've tried to do some things differently from traditional LARP in order to create exactly the right atmosphere for
    Gritlands.

    <strong>Here are some of the objectives we are trying to hit:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Players are encouraged to specialise and work together - the world is harsh and cooperation is key</li>
        <li>Players make choices and decisions that matter - HOTZONES are tactical problems that can be solved in a
            variety of ways</li>
        <li>Players must be proactive - waiting for a ref in order to do things kills pace and tension</li>
        <li>Players have narrative control over the harm they suffer - they can choose to suffer in interesting ways
        </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Game Context</h2>
<p>The Game is set in a satirical post apocalyptic future as outlined in the Setting Document and Clan Overviews.</p>

<p>The game is about the exploits of a ragtag expeditionary force established by four allied - but very different - post
    apocalyptic societies: the clans of the Coalition.</p>

<p>This expeditionary force - the Coalition Recon and Salvage Service (<strong>C.R.A.S.S</strong>) - travels to
    <strong>HOTZONES</strong>: environments so dangerous that they cannot be entered by the weak, unprepared or unwary
    on account of <strong>CERTAIN DEATH</strong>. The Expeditionary force enters these Hot Zones in order to gain access
    to valuable resources, ancient technologies, secrets of the world before, and the cause of the fall.
</p>

<p>The Clans will pitch their four camps together - with a joint command and muster area in the middle. Players will be
    provided with varying information and resources based on outcomes of previous events. Together, the Clans will
    interact, plan, craft, socialise and scheme.</p>

<p>NPCs from various Clans and organisations with varied agendas - from curious locals to hostile forces will pass
    through the camp providing opportunity, information, intrigue, threat and flavour.</p>

<p>Players will arrange expeditions into the HOTZONE: while each Clan will have their own goals for these
    expeditions, NPCs may also provide side-plots or secondary objectives, and players might have their own agendas too.
    Player actions at an event will impact the next event - contributing to the information and resources provided at
    the start of that event, and general direction of overall campaign plot.</p>
