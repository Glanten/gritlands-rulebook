<h1>Tasks</h1>
<p>
    Any activity that is governed by games mechanics (outside of Combat) is a <strong>TASK</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    Some skills provide access to <strong>TASK</strong> that a character can choose to undertake in specific
    circumstances.
</p>

<p>
    Other <strong>TASKS</strong> are detailed on the information TAGS found scattered throughout the game.
</p>

<p>
    A <strong>TASK</strong> has an outcome that players (generally) want to achieve.
</p>

<p>
    All <strong>TASKS</strong> require a period of appropriate roleplay as a minimum to achieve the outcome.
</p>

<p>
    Most <strong>TASKS</strong> will also require additional prerequisites to be met. These could include one or
    more of the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>GRIT</strong> Expenditure (one off, or over time) by an individual OR group of players
    </li>
    <li>
        Possession of certain Skills, possibly at certain levels, by one or more of the participants
    </li>
    <li>
        Possession of certain items or Information, by one or more of the participants
    </li>
    <li>
        A successful <strong>TASK</strong> check (a randomising factor, consisting of a bag of beads, from which
        certain colours must be drawn)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The most complex <strong>TASKS</strong> will make use of a <strong>GERM</strong> (Gritlands Ersatz Referee
    Mechanism): This is a set of numbered cards, each of which contains directions for completing the TASK and lists
    choices the player may take. Each choice then directs them to a different numbered card. Cards may also contain
    additional information, or direct the player to do various other things.
</p>

<p>
    if you are undertaking a TASK and are interrupted, the TASK fails and you lose the GRIT spent.

    <p>
        In the HOTZONE there are various things to do. Let's call these things TASKS. That might be opening a door, or
        it might be repairing an air pump, or it might be investigating the decaying file system haunted by ancient
        system ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
        TASKS will generally be labelled and clearly described - Often with an associated TAG.
    </p>
    <p>
        The action options and requirements will be clearly described. They will consist of one (usually at least 2) or
        more of the following things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Appropriate Role-play. Standing around timidly tapping at a piece of armour is not appropriate role play for
            armour repair. Throw yourself into it - for scouting tags, once you have the information you should sniff
            the air, run the dirt between you r fingers, lick the wall, examine the lichen growing on the bark of a
            tree...
        </li>
        <li>
            Time. Any task is going to take a period of time.
        </li>
        <li>
            GRIT expenditure. A number of grit points must be expended. Sometimes a discount may be available for
            characters with certain skills.
        </li>
        <li>
            Skill levels - certain skill levels are required.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bead Pulls - some tasks require a character to draw beads from a bag. Once a certain number / colour /
            pattern has been drawn an outcome is achieved.
        </li>
        <li>
            Doing a bead pull at Advantage means you draw 2 and choose the best one. A bead pull at disadvantage means
            you draw 2 (or more) and choose the worst one.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gritlands Ersatz Referee Mechanism (GERMS) - a series of cards describes each step in the task resolution;
            some cards present choices and options for the card you go to next.
        </li>
    </ul>
