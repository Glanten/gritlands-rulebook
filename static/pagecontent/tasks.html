<h1>Tasks</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        Any activity that is governed by games mechanics (outside of Combat) is a <strong>TASK</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some skills provide access to <strong>TASK</strong> that a character can choose to undertake in specific
        circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>
        Other <strong>TASKS</strong> are detailed on the information TAGS found scattered throughout the game.
    </p>

    <p>
        A <strong>TASK</strong> has an outcome that players (generally) want to achieve.
    </p>

    <p>
        All <strong>TASKS</strong> require a period of appropriate roleplay as a minimum to achieve the outcome.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most <strong>TASKS</strong> will also require additional prerequisites to be met. These could include one or
        more of the
        following:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>GRIT</strong> Expenditure (one off, or over time) by an individual OR group of players
        </li>
        <li>
            Possession of certain Skills, possibly at certain levels, by one or more of the participants
        </li>
        <li>
            Possession of certain items or Information, by one or more of the participants
        </li>
        <li>
            A successful <strong>TASK</strong> check (a randomising factor, consisting of a bag of beads, from which
            certain colours must be drawn)
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The most complex <strong>TASKS</strong> will make use of a <strong>GERM</strong> (Gritlands Ersatz Referee
        Mechanism): This is a set of numbered cards, each of which contains directions for completing the TASK and lists
        choices the player may take. Each choice then directs them to a different numbered card. Cards may also contain
        additional information, or direct the player to do various other things.
