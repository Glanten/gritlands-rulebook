<h1>Character Creation</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
    Characters consist of a concept, a clan, an archetype, <strong>GRIT</strong>, consequence track, skills and talents.
</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>
    Characters should have a strong and setting appropriate concept. The majority of characters should be part of a
    group. Details regarding your character's name, attitudes and beliefs, ideals, goals, personality traits and more
    are what brings your character to life, rather than the mechanical skills and talents you select.
</p>

<h2>Clan</h2>
<p>
    The Clan that a character belongs to will shape their outlook, agenda, approach, and flavour their mechanical
    options in terms of available archetypes and skills. Each of the clans provides a varying pool of centralised
    resources which are shared between the groups that make them up.
</p>

<h2>Grit</h2>
<p>
    Every Character starts with a pool of 6 <strong>GRIT</strong>. This can be modified by Skills, Talents and
    Equipment.
</p>

<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>
    Every character starts with the following Consequence Track. This can be modified by Skills and Talents.
</p>
<div>
    <table class="consequence_track">
        <tr>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>0</strong></td>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>1</strong></td>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>2</strong></td>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>3</strong></td>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>4</strong></td>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>0</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="no_border">Healthy</td>
            <td class="no_border">Minor</td>
            <td class="no_border">Moderate</td>
            <td class="no_border">Major</td>
            <td class="no_border">Critical</td>
            <td class="no_border">Terminal</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<h2>Skills and Talents</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        Skills are broad or powerful mechanical abilities players can buy for their characters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Skills are purchased in levels, with each level granting additional benefits. Each skill can be purchased up to
        Level 3.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the abilities a skill grants, it also gives access to a set of talents. These are cheaper, more
        limited abilities, which often improve on the base skill in minor ways.
    </p>
    <h3>Starting Skills and Choosing Skills</h3>
    <p>
        Every character starts with the following 'Everypony skills and talents':
    <ul>
        <li><strong>& Chewing Gum</strong> skill at level 1</li>
        <li>The <strong>Pipe Guns</strong> talent</li>
        <li>The <strong>Hand Weapons</strong> talent</li>
        <li>The <strong>War Paint</strong> talent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Every character that picks an Archetype to belong to gets the 3 Archetype Base Skills for their archetype, and
        12 more points to spend on talents and skills. Any Character who eschews the archetypes is an Oddball. They get
        18 points to spend on skills and talents.
