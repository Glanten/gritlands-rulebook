    <p>
        GRIT is measure of your characters mental and physical fortitude, luck, determination, karma and creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
        GRIT has many, many uses in the game:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Avoiding Harm - anytime you take HARM (NOT when you take GRIEVOUS HARM) you may spend one grit from your
            pool to ignore that harm and avoid taking a consequence.
        </li>
        <li>
            Powering Skills - many skills require you to spend 1 (or more) points of Grit in order to activate their
            more powerful effects. Details are found in individual skill descriptions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Performing TASKS - most tasks require some element of GRIT expenditure.
        </li>
        <li>
            Overcoming Obstacles - many obstacles in the Hotzone can be overcome through sheer determination, tenacity,
            luck or creativity. The INFO TAG on the Obstacle will provide the details you need to understand the options
            available to you.
        </li>
        <li>
            Other stuff - GRIT has other uses as well, which will be made clear as and when you can use it.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Equipment, Consumables and GRIT</h3>
    <p>
        There are items available in the game that can be used in place of spending a point of GRIT or add to the GRIT
        being spent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of these may only be used in certain circumstances or for certain purposes. These uses will be clear in the
        description of the item (see Equipment for more details).
    </p>

    <h3>Recovering GRIT</h3>
    <p>
        GRIT is fully restored every morning at time-in.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the course of the day players may find opportunities to restore 1 or more points of GRIT through the use
        of skills, equipment or consumables - details can be found in the individual descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Traditions: each Clan has specific traditions that they can use to regain GRIT. Leading the ritual requires a
        specific skill, but all members of the Clan can benefit from it (if they participate) without needing any
        special skills.
