<h1>Tags</h1>
<p>
    TAGS are used to communicate information to the players. TAGS will be placed on or adjacent to any physical item
    they refer to. TAG colour and Iconography will make it clear to players who can or cannot interact with the TAG.
</p>
<strong>TAGS generally do one or both of the following</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        Impart Information (either generally, or for players with specific abilities)
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe one or more <strong>TASKS</strong>, possibly including one or more <strong>GERMs</strong>
    </li>
</ul>

        TAGS exist to reduce the burden on referees / game team, and to allow the player more freedom and agency to
        split up, pursue different goals and objectives and act on inspiration or good ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the HOTZONE various TAGS Exist. These will (usually) be obvious and attached to various obstacles, prominent
        features, even Opposition.

        TAGS will always include a Visible Sign. Many tags will have a series of laminated cards attached. The first of
        these cards should be read and will provide instructions on who and when to read any other cards.
