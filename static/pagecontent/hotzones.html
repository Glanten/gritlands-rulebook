<h1>HOTZONES</h1>
<p>
    Every event will contain 1 or more HOTZONES.
</p>

<p>
    Each HOTZONE will be a unique combination of Environmental Threats, Inhabitants, Hazard and Obstacles
    (<strong>TASKS</strong>):
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Environmental Threats</strong> - A HOTZONE is a HOTZONE because its environment presents a threat to
    would-be scavengers: If you spend too long in any HOTZONE it will kill you in some unpleasant way. There are a wide
    variety of environmental threats, some of the most common are Radiation, Disease, Poison and Nanites. Each of those
    comes in a variety of types, and areas home to more exotic forms of invisible death are discovered every year.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Inhabitants</strong> - are those poor wretches, or horrific mutants who have somehow found a way to adapt to
    or survive in the zone - they are often (but not always) hostile.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Hazards</strong> - It is not just the air that will kill you - HOTZONEs are often home to other, more
    mundane, immediate or unexpected hazards - leaking bombs, radiation pools, automated defence grids, weaponized
    Polka.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Obstacles</strong> - these are various barriers that impede the scavengers process through the zone. Obvious
    examples are locked doors or barricades, but arcane computer systems, forensic mysteries, broken machinery and more
    also fall into this category. These will invariably be marked with TAGS.

        Gritlands is, unashamedly, a game of action and adventure in the HOTZONES - the most dangerous locales in the
        Gritlands
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be doing things. Lots of things.

        This section covers how you achieve various things within the context of the game.

    <h3>
        The Role of a HOTZONE
    </h3>
    <p>
        The HOTZONES are integral to Gritlands. They are the very reason that the Salvage Force has been sent out, and
        they contain within them valuable resources and the answers to mysteries that are essential to the survival of
        the Clans.
    </p>
    <p>
        HOTZONES are live environments loaded with inhabitants, creatures, secrets, loot, puzzles, knowledge and more.
        As the Campaign progresses Characters will have increased control over which HOTZONES they visit, as they chase
        down the plots and secrets that interest them.
    </p>
    <div class="pink_text">
        <p>
            <strong>Design Note</strong>: Access to the HOTZONE may be limited by an OOC schedule (to ensure resources
            are available). There will always be an IC gloss applied to this for the sake of narrative and immersion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally after leaving a HOTZONE each character has a 1 hour cool down, during which they cannot safely
            enter the HOTZIBE again.
        </p>
        <p>
            These 2 conceits ensure that we can provide a consistent experience and keep a turn over of players cycling
            through, without any one group “hogging the zone”
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Components</h3>
    <p>
        Every HOTZONE has the following components
    </p>
    <strong>Objectives</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Are the important targets for the players. They drive plot, provide huge material rewards, and or point the
            way to the next mysteries for the players to resolve.
        </li>
        <li>
            They are at the heart of the HOTZONES
        </li>
        <li>
            Not all objectives are advertised up front
        </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Loot</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Is the other cool stuff that can be found in the HOTZONE
        </li>
        <li>
            Ammo, resources, maps, secrets, knowledge
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong style="color: orangered;">Update</strong>: To loot a downed participant you must spend 60 seconds
        phys-repping searching them [this is done by saying 'I am searching you' and then doing 60 seconds cool
        searching roleplay without touching them and then saying 'you are searched'].
    </p>
    <p>
        Once this action is performed the participant is obliged to turn over all <strong>IC</strong> items they are
        carrying to the searcher including ammo in any <strong>IC</strong> weapons they are carrying. It is possible for
        some participants (Bots we are looking at you here) that a <strong>TASK</strong> may need to be completed to
        access any loot they are carrying.
    </p>

    <h3>Environment</h3>
    <p>
        This is what makes the zone HOT. Generally the environment will inflict HARM at routine intervals. This means
        that staying too long is potentially fatal for any character, and getting trapped, or not paying attention to
        the time is a big deal.
    </p>

    <h3>Inhabitants</h3>
    <p>
        Most Hotzones are home to some problematic denizens...
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In some Hotzones the denizens are so numerous that they are the environmental problem; in others they are an
            additional or occasional threat
        </li>
        <li>Mutants</li>
        <li>Robots</li>
        <li>Monsters</li>
        <li>Meat-Freaks</li>
        <li>Wasteland cults</li>
        <li>Hidden armies</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hard Obstacles</h3>
    <p>
        Hard Obstacles are physically present and must be interacted with, manipulated or avoided by the players actual
        hard skills (physical and mental.) Hard Obstacles can be overcome without any IC skills.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tripwires</li>
        <li>Ladders</li>
        <li>Puzzles</li>
        <li>Searchlights</li>
        <li>Tunnels</li>
        <li>Motion sensors</li>
    </ul>
