<h1>HOTZONES</h1>
<div>

    <p>
        Every event will contain 1 or more HOTZONES.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each HOTZONE will be a unique combination of Environmental Threats, Inhabitants, Hazard and Obstacles
        (<strong>TASKS</strong>):
    </p>

    <p>
        Environmental Threats - A HOTZONE is a HOTZONE because its environment presents a threat to would-be
        scavengers: If you spend too long in any HOTZONE it will kill you in some unpleasant way. There are a wide
        variety of environmental threats, some of the most common are Radiation, Disease, Poison and Nanites. Each of
        those comes in a variety of types, and areas home to more exotic forms of invisible death are discovered every
        year.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Inhabitants</strong> - are those poor wretches, or horrific mutants who have somehow found a way to
        adapt to or survive
        in
        the zone - they are often (but not always) hostile.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Hazards</strong> - It is not just the air that will kill you - HOTZONEs are often home to other, more
        mundane, immediate
        or unexpected hazards - leaking bombs, radiation pools, automated defence grids, weaponized Polka.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Obstacles</strong> - these are various barriers that impede the scavengers process through the zone.
        Obvious examples are
        locked doors or barricades, but arcane computer systems, forensic mysteries, broken machinery and more also fall
        into this category. These will invariably be marked with TAGS.
