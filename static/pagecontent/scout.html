    <p>
        Primarily concerned with assessing and surveying the blasted wasteland, Scouts tend to be tough, stealthy,
        survivors, able to assess the lay of the land, spot and circumvent the many hazards and dangers that the wastes,
        and the Hot Zones throw at them. They are INVALUABLE - without them you will get poisoned, irradiated, ambushed
        or
        worse.

            Nu-Gov may despise the wasteland for its disorderly attempts to engulf the remnants of civilisations, but
            that
            doesn't mean they intend to remain ignorant about the dangers of the new world.

    <div id="scavenger_content">
        <p>
            Of all the clans, the Wastelanders know best the dangers of the wasteland; and amongst the wastelanders,
            their
            scouts know best how to endure those dangers. The Wastelanders are nomadic, and they rely on their
            scavengers
            not only to identify reliable routes and find suitable shelter, but also to lead the clan to scrap and raw
            materials that they can trade for food, water, and medicine.

        <p>
            Quaestors eschew the beaten steel of the Knight so that they can more easily traverse the Roads and face the
            wastes in-between. They are tasked in keeping the scattered settlements of the Realm connected - no matter
            what.
            Outriders and scouts, the Quaestors are wise in identifying and neutralising the many dangers that lurk just
            off
            of the path.

            The Host has eyes and ears everywhere; some of them don't try to hide their role, and the Host's pilgrims
            act as
            watchers, informers, and forward observers. Whenever the Host finds a radioactive artefact they can
            enshrine, or
            a ruined structure they can re-purpose, or whenever they are forewarned of a razor-dust storm (so half of
            them
            can batten down the hatches while the other half strip naked and prepare to receive divine judgement from
            the
            wind), it is the pilgrims who identified what the wastes have in store...
