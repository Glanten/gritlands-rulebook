<h1>Enabler</h1>
<p>
    The strength of the enclaves - and of humanity itself - its very survival through the horrors of the last centuries
    are entirely dependent on humankind's ability to cooperate (or at the very least coordinate). Enablers hold society
    together, and drive it to become greater than the sum of its parts. They are INVALUABLE - because without them you
    are nothing more than a solitary lost monkey screaming into the face of annihilation.
