<h1>Mutations</h1>
<p>
    Mutations are a special set of Talents under the ...& Chewing Gum Skill.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the skill point cost for the mutation each one requires a high quality prosthetic and/or costume
    modification that is appropriate to represent the Mutation/ability chosen.
</p>
<h2>Mutant Prosthetics and Makeup</h2>
<p>
    Choosing to be a mutant is a serious commitment in terms of kit, costume and makeup. Ear tips and a bit of snazz
    will not cut it. Ending the day with half your makeup rubbed off on your sleeve and two spirit gum circles where
    your horns used to be is no good either.
</p>
<p>
    Prosthetics should be high quality, durable. Make up should be nuanced and tough enough to withstand an athletic day
    in the zone. Everything should be perky and seem alive - no flaccid tails or tentacles hanging limply from your
    waist... Body parts should look connected - not like a pair of gloves/shoes/shoulder pads with spikes glued to them.
</p>
<p>
    The hassles are a poor trade off for the abilities you get access to. Do it because you love the concept.
</p>
