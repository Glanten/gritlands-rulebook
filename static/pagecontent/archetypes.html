<h1>Archetypes</h1>
<p>
    There are 5 broad archetypes available. Archetypes provide a mechanical benefit by grouping together related skills
    and making them cheaper to purchase and advance. Archetypes also fit within their clan in a clearly defined way.
    Rather than picking an Archetype, you can choose to be an Oddball. Weirdo.
