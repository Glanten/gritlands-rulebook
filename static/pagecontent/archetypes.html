<h1>Archetypes</h1>
<p>
    There are 5 broad archetypes available. Archetypes provide a mechanical benefit by grouping together related skills
    and making them cheaper to purchase and advance. Archetypes also fit within their clan in a clearly defined way.
    Rather than picking an Archetype, you can choose to be an Oddball. Weirdo.

<h2>Scout</h2>
<p>
    Primarily concerned with assessing and surveying the blasted wasteland, Scouts tend to be tough, stealthy,
    survivors, able to assess the lay of the land, spot and circumvent the many hazards and dangers that the wastes,
    and the Hot Zones throw at them. They are INVALUABLE - without them you will get poisoned, irradiated, ambushed or
    worse.
</p>
<h2>Warrior</h2>
<p>
    Everyone knows to carry a big stick and conserve ammo for the worst of circumstances. But warriors excel at taking
    and dealing out raw violence. A handy trick in such a brutal, violent world inhabited by monsters, horrors and
    unscrupulous or psychotic survivors who will murder you dead as soon as look at you. They are INVALUABLE - without
    them you stand no chance against the hordes of beings who want to kill you and wear your skin like a dress.
</p>
<h2>Scientist</h2>
<p>
    You need every edge you can get in Hot Zones and Drugs will often be the first, last and most fun way to get that
    edge. But Even then - sometimes - you will get shot, stabbed, beaten and blown up. When this happens you are going
    to need someone to patch you up and make the pain go away. They are INVALUABLE - as a shot of Adreno-Bang might be
    the only thing to get you through, and no one wants to try sewing their own intestines back into their body.
</p>
<h2>Engineer</h2>
<p>
    If drugs give you the edge then the rest of the shape is made up of your gear. Without it you might as well not
    leave the safety of the enclaves. Not that there would be enclaves without engineers - they keep everything running
    in good order and use their ingenuity and opposable thumbs to solve problems that would otherwise be beyond the
    abilities of anyone. They are INVALUABLE - as you are worse than toast without decent gear.
</p>
<h2>Enablers</h2>
<p>
    The strength of the enclaves - and of humanity itself - its very survival through the horrors of the last centuries
    are entirely dependent on humankind's ability to cooperate (or at the very least coordinate). Enablers hold society
    together, and drive it to become greater than the sum of its parts. They are INVALUABLE - because without them you
    are nothing more than a solitary lost monkey screaming into the face of annihilation.
</p>
<h2>Oddballs</h2>
<p>
    Some people are just square pegs. But sometimes that is what you need.
