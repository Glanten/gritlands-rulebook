<h1>Archetypes</h1>
<p>
    Archetypes provide a mechanical benefit by grouping together related skills, making them cheaper to purchase and
    advance.
</p>
<p>
    Archetypes also fit within their clan in a clearly defined way; an Engineer from NuGov goes about things very
    differently to an Engineer from the Wastelanders.

    Rather than picking an Archetype, you can choose to be an Oddball. Weirdo.
