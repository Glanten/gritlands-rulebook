<h1>Disclaimers</h1>
<h2>Living Document Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Back in the olden times of LARP you would create some cool documents with your rules on them and adhere to them come
    what may - dying on multiple hills to preserve your precious, perfect vision. Those times are thankfully (mostly)
    behind us as a community.</p>

<p>That's why all our rules, background and game mechanics are subject to change if they don't survive contact with the
    reality of playing them out in an abandoned military base. These will be living documents and we will be hosting
    only the current version with changes to those documents will be communicated clearly through our social media
    presence.</p>

<p>We rely on honest and constructive feedback from our players to make our game better and we welcome post event
    feedback to our official email addresses which can be found elsewhere in this document.</p>

<h2>Beta Rules and Feedback</h2>
<p>To hammer the point above home - this version of the rules is the first Beta release (v0.1.0). We expect it as an
    inevitability that we'll soon be made aware of every flaw, every unintended interaction, and each ounce of
    inconsistency that we have missed. We look forward to being taught how to min-max in ways we never even consideredâ€¦
</p>

<p>We also recognise that what we think we've said or explained may be interpreted differently by a player base
    encountering it for the first time.</p>

<p>So we are keen for your feedback: You can use our Facebook page for this - or you can provide it directly by emailing
    feedback@Gritlands.co.uk.</p>

<h2>Updates and DLC</h2>

<h2>Proofing and Typos</h2>

    where it can be found to Feedback@Gritlands.co.uk and we will exterminate it with extreme prejudice.
