    <p>
        There are four firearm categories available, Pipe Guns, Pistols, Street Sweepers and 'Eavy Weapons. All of them
        represent various broad categories of ancient, barely functional or cobbled together weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Pipe Guns</b>: These are large cumbersome single shot weapons wielded in two hands that require no skill
        whatsoever to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Pistols</b>: These are single shot, multi chambered but low capacity weapons wielded in one hand that require
        an acquired skill to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Street Sweepers</b>: These are single shot, high capacity multi chambered weapons that can be wielded in one
        or two hands that require an acquired skill to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>'Eavy (Heavy) Weapons</b>: These are high capacity automatic or semi automatic weapons that must be wielded
        in two hands and require an acquired skill type to use. In addition they have a different ammo type to other
        weapons.

        As standard all player weapons fire Nerf brand 'Mega Darts', these are supplied by the game organisers. You are
        not permitted to bring your own darts. All firearms except 'Eavy Weapons can be loaded or part loaded with mega
        darts you acquire in the game world.
    </p>
    <p>
        'Eavy weapons take plasma cells (found in game as bundles of darts in a container). Plasma cells can not be part
        loaded. A plasma cell can only be recharged into a firearm by some one with the engineer skill.
    </p>
    <p>
        There may be on occasion firearms in the hands of adversaries or available in specific scenarios which use
        different ammo types, these represent high tech items with limited use.
    </p>
    <h3>Dart Collection and reuse</h3>
    <p>
        As part of our blaster safety rules no spent darts can be collected from the floor and reused. All darts must be
        returned to GOD for checking before they are re-issued into the game.
