<h1>Characters</h1>
<p>
    Each player should have an active character with which to play the game.
</p>
<p>
    Each Player can have only one active character at any time.
</p>
<p>
    If a player's active character dies or is retired, the player may replace them with a new character.
</p>
<p>
    No player may play a dead or retired character. Once a character has died or been retired, they are permanently
    removed from play.
</p>
<p>
    Characters are defined by their base attributes (see below) which come from their choice of <strong>Clan</strong>,
    <strong>Archetype</strong>, <strong>Skills</strong>, and <strong>Talents</strong>.

    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>
        Characters consist of a concept, a clan, an archetype, <strong>GRIT</strong>, consequence track, skills and
        talents.
    </p>

    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
        Characters should have a strong and setting appropriate concept. The majority of characters should be part of a
        group. Details regarding your character's name, attitudes and beliefs, ideals, goals, personality traits and
        more
        are what brings your character to life, rather than the mechanical skills and talents you select.
    </p>

    <h3>Clan</h3>
    <p>
        The Clan that a character belongs to will shape their outlook, agenda, approach, and flavour their mechanical
        options in terms of available archetypes and skills. Each of the clans provides a varying pool of centralised
        resources which are shared between the groups that make them up.
    </p>

    <h3>Grit</h3>
    <p>
        Every Character starts with a pool of 6 <strong>GRIT</strong>. This can be modified by Skills, Talents and
        Equipment.
    </p>

    <h3>Consequences</h3>
    <p>
        Every character starts with the following Consequence Track. This can be modified by Skills and Talents.
    </p>
    <table class="consequence_track">
        <tr>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>0</strong></td>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>1</strong></td>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>2</strong></td>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>3</strong></td>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>4</strong></td>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>0</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="no_border">Healthy</td>
            <td class="no_border">Minor</td>
            <td class="no_border">Moderate</td>
            <td class="no_border">Major</td>
            <td class="no_border">Critical</td>
            <td class="no_border">Terminal</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Skills and Talents</h3>
    <p>
        Skills are broad or powerful mechanical abilities players can buy for their characters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Skills are purchased in levels, with each level granting additional benefits. Each skill can be purchased up to
        Level 3.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the abilities a skill grants, it also gives access to a set of talents. These are cheaper, more
        limited abilities, which often improve on the base skill in minor ways.
    </p>
    <h3>Starting Skills and Choosing Skills</h3>
    <p>
        Every character starts with the following 'Everypony skills and talents':
    <ul>
        <li><strong>& Chewing Gum</strong> skill at level 1</li>
        <li>The <strong>Pipe Guns</strong> talent</li>
        <li>The <strong>Hand Weapons</strong> talent</li>
        <li>The <strong>War Paint</strong> talent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Every character that picks an Archetype to belong to gets the 3 Archetype Base Skills for their archetype, and
        12 more points to spend on talents and skills. Any Character who eschews the archetypes is an Oddball. They get
        18 points to spend on skills and talents.
    </p>
    </p>

    <h3>Purchasing and Advancing Skills</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>For each archetype skills are divided into 3 categories:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Core skills</strong>: These are the skills most closely tied to the Archetype. They always include the
        Archetypes Unique skill(s). Core skills cost 3 points per level.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>General skills</strong>: These are the skills which are more broadly developed by the archetype. General
        skills cost 4 points per level.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Uncommon skills</strong>: These skills are only distantly related to the Archetypes core activities, or
        they are very difficult to develop in general. Uncommon skills cost 5 points per level.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most Archetypes have two or three skills that they cannot access. That's life.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some Skills and talents might have prerequisites - usually a minimum level in a given skill, another talent, or
        occasionally another skill before they can be purchased. These will be noted in parenthesis next to the skill/
        talent name.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some skills and talents may be limited to specific characters - most often this will be by archetype.
        Occasionally it will be a limited number of purchases per level of associated skill. The details should be clear
        from the descriptions provided.
    </p>

    <p>
        When Advancing a skill from a lower to a higher level, the mechanical effect of that skill is replaced by the
        description at the new level.
    </p>

    <p>
        Skill points not spent at the end of character creation are retained.
    </p>

    <h3>Trappings</h3>
    <p>
        In addition to their costume (which may or may not count as War Paint, or 'Eavy Metal if they have those skills)
        characters can have the following <strong>STUFF</strong>:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Physreps representing the <strong>FOCI</strong> for any weapon they have the Talent to use
        </li>
        <li>
            Physreps representing the <strong>FOCI</strong> for any Shield they can use
        </li>
        <li>
            Physreps representing the <strong>FOCI</strong> required for Any Skill or Talent they have (eg: First Aid
            Kit, Medical Bag, Survey equipment)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Other items from the <strong>STUFF</strong> list that fits their clan/group and character concept.
    </p>

    <h3>Advancement</h3>
    <p>
        As your character survives their forays into the Hot Zone they might pick up a thing or two about staying not
        dead.
    </p>
    <p>
        You earn 2 skill points at the end of each event you attend.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong style="color: orangered;">Update</strong>: You may re-spend your points at any time before an event. If
        you change archetype you lose your accumulated <strong>XP</strong>.
    </p>
