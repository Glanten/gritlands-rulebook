<h1>Characters</h1>
<p>
    Each player should have an active character with which to play the game.
</p>
<p>
    Each Player can have only one active character at any time.
</p>
<p>
    If a player's active character dies or is retired, the player may replace them with a new character.
</p>
<p>
    No player may play a dead or retired character. Once a character has died or been retired, they are permanently
    removed from play.
</p>
<p>
    Characters are defined by their base attributes (see below) which come from their choice of <strong>Clan</strong>,
    <strong>Archetype</strong>, <strong>Skills</strong>, and <strong>Talents</strong>.

        <strong>Clan</strong><br />
        A character's clan informs their appearance, philosophy, and roleplaying cues.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Archetype</strong><br />
        Archetype determines a character's specialism and routes of progression.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>GRIT</strong><br />
        All characters start with a baseline of <strong>6 GRIT</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        GRIT is a pool of points which are used to absorb harm and fuel abilities.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Consequences</strong><br />
        All characters start with a baseline of <strong>4 Consequence</strong> slots.
    </p>
    <p>
        Characters track harm that they do not absorb with GRIT as Consequences. An overabundance of Consequences can
        lead to character death (or worse).
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Skills</strong><br />
        Skills allow characters to interact with the world (and other characters) in powerful ways.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most skills progress from level 1 to level 3.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Talents</strong><br />
        Talents are abilities beyond skills and are normally specialisations within a skill that make a character even
        more powerful in a specific area.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Equipment</strong><br />
        Some equipment will provide a mechanical advantage to its user; other equipment just makes a character look cool
        (surely the real goal of any LARP).
