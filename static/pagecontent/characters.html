<h1>Characters</h1>
<p>
    Players create Characters. Each Player can have only 1 character at any time - upon death, the newly-dead character
    no longer counts towards this limit. Characters are built by choosing a Clan and an Archetype - which defines both
    the pool of skills they can learn and how relatively difficult those skills are to develop.

    Characters start with <strong>6 GRIT</strong> as standard. <strong>GRIT</strong> is a pool of points which are used
    to absorb <strong>HARM</strong> and to fuel
    abilities

    Characters track <strong>HARM</strong> that they do not absorb with <strong>GRIT</strong> on their
    <strong>CONSEQUENCE TRACK</strong>

    Characters start with <strong>4 CONSEQUENCE SLOTS</strong> as standard
