<h2>Who are NuGov?</h2>
<p>
    The remnants of national civil power centres from the Before Times, and those who worked with or supported them
    closely, clinging onto the traditions of the past as a means of unlocking the secrets of the Gritlands. These are
    the descendants of government enclaves desperate to turn the clock back to a time when they had power, respect, and
    stability.
</p>

<h3>Three Things They Are</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Desperately harking back to a past that didn't actually exist. Imagine a tourist's idea of England writ large,
        plasticy and twee.
    </li>
    <li>
        Hierarchical. People know their place and don't question it, this way is the best way to rebuild the new world
        irrespective of the cost in personal freedom. Everyone in the system knows their place and is happy with it.
    </li>
    <li>
        A pastiche of 80's Conservatism. Authoritarianism dressed up as opportunity.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Three Things They Are Not</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Nazis. NuGov does not discriminate against race, sexuality, gender, or religious beliefs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Soldiers. The military establishment was washed away in the End Times, NuGov are very much the remains of civil
        authority, not military authority. As such, overly militaristic tropes and costume are not appropriate.
    </li>
    <li>
        Self-aware. The people of NuGov are not self aware of the utter ludicrosity they are perpetuating as they risk
        life, limb and resource to recover a near pristine red phone box from a hellish rad zone infested with
        kill-bots.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Look and Feel</h2>
<p>
    Battered 80s business attire, bowler hats, old police/fire/ambulance/nurse uniforms, riot armour, overalls, number
    stencilled jumpsuits for the lower echelons of society, briefcases, elaborate tea ceremonies, Thatcher Icons,
    typical cockney attire (pearly Queens and Kings), awful UK-centric tourist tat, truncheons, fire axes, hammers,
    stanley knives. Rigid hierarchy, greed. A mixture of upright corporate types, shifty cockneys, and indentured
    servants in numbered jumpsuits.
</p>

<h3>What To Avoid</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Steampunks
    </li>
    <li>
        Camo gear / military uniforms
    </li>
    <li>
        Urban ninjas
    </li>
    <li>
        Cyberpunks
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Hierarchy</h2>
<p>
    NuGov is kept running by a labyrinthine bureaucracy of ministers, secretaries, inspectors, overseers, underseers,
    directors, indirectors and at least a dozen even less defined roles all associated with a legion more subcommittees,
    portfolios and steering panels whose names and purpose have been lifted whole from documents from the Before without
    care or consideration for context or meaning. This pinstriped heap constitutes the Cabinet - and perched at its peak
    is the Minister of the Prime Chamber and it is by their biro that fortunes rise and fall - entire departments being
    formed and dissolved by the filing (or misfiling) of paperwork descending from the Chamber.
</p>
<p>
    The Delegated Powers Legislation Committee is the current body with the authority to approve applications for the
    formation of C.R.A.S.S expeditions. Through its head Permanent Senior Civil Servant and under the watchful eye of
    the Prime Chamber's own Permanent Under-Secretary to the Minister with Portfolio, the DPLC is responsible for
    assigning representatives from the relevant ministries required for delving into a hot-zone. This includes, but is
    not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Sub-Committee on Security and Investment in Technological Artefacts
    </li>
    <li>
        The Abhuman Audit and Risk Committee
    </li>
    <li>
        The Biological and Chemical Polyphenol Regulation Committee
    </li>
    <li>
        The Secondary Board of Munitions
    </li>
    <li>
        The Speaker's Committee on Electoral and Administrative Affairs
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>ID Cards</h2>
<p>
    Citizens of the NuGov must, at all times, have their identity card prepared and ready to present to a ministry
    representative. ID cards are not necessarily uniform in appearance, but they must contain specific information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Name (the individual's handle, moniker, or identifying designation)</li>
    <li>Borough or Parish (the individual's current abode)</li>
    <li>Tax Bracket (rated from A to 7, including sub-bracket rated from Î© to iiv)</li>
    <li>Humanity (genetic adherence to baseline human biology, represented on a percentile scale)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mutants and NuGov</h2>
<p>
    NuGov has, since its earliest records, been vexed and perturbed by mutants: interpretations of its founding
    documents clearly state that every aspect of a "phenotypically challenged" individual's day to day life must be
    supported by additional paperwork and licences: from the "certificates of genetic stability" (form AG- TACA-0121)
    that need to be added to their internal passports (and regularly renewed), to the various addendums and handling
    forms needed to adapt standard paperwork for mutant use
</p>
<p>
    This nightmare of additional bureaucracy means that any decent, pencil-pushing citizen worth their pinstripe suit
    would rather just not deal with mutants at all. Not out of hatred or prejudice - but because who wants to be caught
    short when it comes to paperwork?
</p>
<p>
    This is an arrangement that most mutants seem fairly happy with.
</p>

<h2>Territory</h2>
<p>
    The Capitol, also known as Fortress Keynes, is the remains of a perfectly-structured city that somehow avoided the
    Scars of the end times. Craters, sinkholes, and trench networks form an exceptionally hazardous moat around the
    city, limiting access to tunnels bristling with traps, dead ends, and patrols of highly-regulated enforcers.
</p>

<h2>Role Among the Clans</h2>
<p>
    NuGov's strict adherence to rules and procedure has made them the perfect caretakers of the clans' water supply.
    Massive industrial pumps bring water up from aquifers deep below the surface to purification tanks. NuGov not only
    treats and tests the water, but also monitors the aquifers and limits their exploitation through measuring and
    rationing appropriately.
</p>
<p>
    While every clan has solar stills and rainwater traps, NuGov can not only provide water in unrivalled quantities,
    but it can also guarantee their water is clean, safe, and good for your teeth.
</p>

<h2>Why Play NuGov?</h2>
<p class="pink_text">
    You should play in NuGov if you have a keen sense of the satirical, a penchant for the highs and lows of 80s culture
    and either love or hate the Tories
