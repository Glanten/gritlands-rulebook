<h2>Who Are The Wastelanders?</h2>
<p>
    Loosely organised and anarchic this clan abandons any firm and strictly enforced set of rules and ideologies in
    favour of a more chaotic lifestyle. They are known for their volatile nature, flare for theatrics and anarchic
    hierarchy. Rarely shying away from violence and conflict the Wastelanders have truly embraced all the new World has
    to offer provided you are prepared to go out and risk all to get it. They believe themselves to be the only true
    free people.
</p>

<h3>Three Things They Are</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Massive showoffs. If there is no audience, did you even do it? The Wastelanders have a savage love of
        showboating and theatrics.
    </li>
    <li>
        Risk Takers. The Wastelanders love to take risks and live life on the edge, why sneak through the ruins when you
        can cartwheel past the auto-turrets?
    </li>
    <li>
        No one is happier with the New World than the Wastelanders, they aren't interested in the past nor in shaping
        the future, the New World is their playground.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Three Things They Are Not</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Evil. While the Wastelanders are certainly anarchic, vibrant, loud and chaotic, they are not evil, bad people,
        or preying on the weak.
    </li>
    <li>
        Suicidal idiots. While they have a healthy love of risk taking, Wastelanders are not idiotically suicidal.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bloodthirsty murderers. Despite their reckless lifestyle the Wastelanders aren't murderous maniacs, they in fact
        feel that life is quite precious.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Look And Feel</h2>
<p>
    Assless chaps, tyre armour, jewellery made from bolts and nuts, scrap metal, outlandish hair, peacocking, looted
    scraps, weird collections, leather, make up, warpaint, style over practicality, recycled sports gear, bike armour,
    makeshift weapons, blades o sticks, concrete and rebar clubs, hub caps for bucklers, car doors for shields, if you
    go 'tribal' keep it UK/Celt centric.
</p>

<h3>What To Avoid</h3>
<ul>
    <li>No medieval style armour</li>
    <li>No ammo gear/military uniforms unless they are utterly ruined</li>
    <li>No chaos cultists</li>
    <li>No battle lingerie</li>
    <li>No Blood/gore/human trophies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hierarchy</h2>
<p>
    The Social Hierarchy of the Wastelanders is almost exactly as chaotic as you might expect. Society is dominated by
    charismatic individuals who rise to occupy positions of influence over sections of the Big Trip. They are often
    buoyed to power by an ever-changing political landscape of gangs and subclans falling in and out with each other
    with individual clan members changing their gang allegiance many times during their lifetimes.
</p>
<p>
    The main mechanism for change of hierarchy is a set of challenges which are never as dull or pedestrian as 'a
    fight'. Eating contests, endurance contests, baffling games of chance and wits, minefield based mini golf are all
    par for the course with the winner celebrated with a rise in social capital. Once those folk are in power their rule
    is near absolute with a sprawling lesser hierarchy beholden only to them and often placed beyond challenge in order
    to get tasks done well with the structure only being overturned when the top of the tree is challenged out of
    position
</p>

<h2>Storytelling</h2>
<p>
    Death-defying exploits and peerless antics are all well and good - but what about after the explosions and the
    chaos? It seems a shame for an escapade to be a flash in the pan - how else can you ensure you get the proper
    recognition for doing something that nobody else has before if people aren't talking about it?
</p>
<p>
    The people in the Old had a solution - mass media - and as the last remaining consumers of the desiccated carcass of
    mass media in the Now, the Wastelanders are well versed in how a good story can be spread - marketed even -
    elevating the tale into something legendary.
</p>
<p>
    Wastelanders with an eye for mimicking the speech and style of the Old in spinning unlikely yarns, exaggerated
    reenactments, tall tales, tributary ballads or hard-hitting exposés (whatever those are) are highly valued by the
    clan for their skill in amplifying the best of the best; the more props, sound effects, wild gestures, and
    supporting actors the better. Some story deliveries are so good that people tell stories about them; naturally the
    stories get more inflated and implausible with each retelling.
</p>

<h2>Mutants and Wastelanders</h2>
<p>
    Being the first to the gene-modding party, mutants are old hat to the Wastelanders; they see mutation as a natural
    embracing of the world's altered state: just as the End has warped the world, so too should one change along with
    it. Their acceptance of the process is so complete as to be blasé and their attitude to the results
    indistinguishable from their wider philosophy around self expression.
</p>
<p>
    Extreme and distinct mutations are highly prized when coupled with the right kind of derring-do, fashion and
    attitude: great things are expected of mutants who choose to stand out of a crowd where everyone is already trying
    to stand out. Everyone remembers the Wastelander who tagged a malfunctioning security robot with a particularly
    off-colour limerick wearing nothing but their ass-bereft leather chaps - but they'd remember it even more if they
    did it with a gnarly pair of crab claws. After all - how did they even hold the can?
</p>
<p>
    This cultural bend towards mutation ironically can place a lot of pressure on mutants - the expectations placed on
    particularly distinct mutations are high and disappointment even more so when the "deeds don't match the looks".
</p>

<h2>Territory</h2>
<p>
    The wastelanders are different to the other three clans in that they do not have a set territory. Their Big Trip
    meanders its way through the wastes ever moving, ever shifting. Subclans and gangs are also in a constant state of
    movement, breaking off from the Big Trip to visit the other Clans' territory to trade, stocking up on food, water,
    medicine, and other supplies before embarking on a Great Journey into the wastes in search of raw materials, scrap,
    salvage, and bizarre tech from the Before Times.
</p>
<p>
    During their long forays the wastelanders encounter some of the weirdest, strangest, most dangerous elements of the
    post apocalyptic landscape. They have always returned, despite the dangers, and although their pilgrimages cost
    lives and test sanity, the resources unearthed by the wastelanders' journeys are vital to building and maintaining a
    life in such harsh conditions.
</p>

<h2>Role Among The Clans</h2>
<p>
    Raw materials are not exactly hard to come by in the wasteland of the future, but good raw materials - that's
    another question entirely. Shelters, settlements, machinery, tools, weapons, rudimentary vehicles, medical and
    scientific equipment, these things all need to be built from something, and while every clan has people dedicated to
    scavenging, no one knows how to find the wastes' hidden treasure troves quite as well as the Wastelanders do.
</p>
<p>
    There is also the fact that the other clans lack the quota of lunatics willing to dive head-first into a pit of
    flesh- eating nanites to retrieve good-quality scrap.
</p>
<p>
    So when the Wastelanders return from their long forays into the brutal, uncaring, ion storm-wracked wilderness, they
    are usually laden down with high-quality scrap and salvage that the other clans desperately need in order to keep
    going. The Wastelanders are low on food, water, and medicine, and so a round of trade takes place with the
    Wastelander caravans making their rounds to the other clan territories to swap goods and supplies until everyone is
    satisfied and the Wastelanders feel they are ready to head back out into the hellscape to see what else they can
    find.
</p>
<p>
    In addition the Wastelanders are the main mechanism of communication between the Clans, running messages and
    carrying packages between them, a task they take extremely seriously and respect the privacy of the contents. They
    remain baffled/annoying/hilarious (delete as appropriate) when the NuGov citizens insist on calling them "Pats"
    after the famous NuGov folk hero and paragon for reliability, punctuality and impeccable adherence to process

<h2>Why Play A Wastelander?</h2>
<p class="pink_text">
    You should play in the Wastelanders if you like living it large, being the centre of the attention, being
    competitive as all hell and wearing assless chaps.
