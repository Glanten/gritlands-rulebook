<h2>Who Are The Unnumbered Host?</h2>
<p>
    The End burnt away the pulpit as easily as it toppled thrones, lecterns and those really tall seats that tennis
    referees sit on; What slow decline and sudden cataclysm could not ablute, two intervening centuries of apocalyptica
    has banished from memory. Whatever beliefs those who suffered through the End may have clung to have settled into
    the background glow of disjointed humanity in the After: their symbols misunderstood, their creed misattributed.
</p>
<p>
    But, as a preacher in the Before once crooned: “You gotta have faith.”.
</p>
<p>
    The Unnumbered Host embodies a host of overlapping beliefs and theories that weave and tangle into a byzantine and
    overlapping community of creeds eternally jockeying for position. From devotees of the White Fire who worship the
    cleansing flame of nuclear purification to the secretive servants of the long lost city of East's End and its
    ancient deity the Beale of Ian, these cults are bound together by a shadowy, enigmatic and all knowing Divine Leader
    who has forged them into an alliance of the faithful when so many in these dark times have turned their backs on
    faith altogether. It will be through this faith - the Host claim - that a new world be forged.
</p>

<h3>Three Things They Are</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Religiously tolerant. While members of the Host might argue from dawn to dusk that theirs is the one true path
        they will absolutely be tolerant and open to debate about any other religious practices that aren't immediately
        abhorrent.
    </li>
    <li>
        Scheming. The Host love to indulge in power games in order to further their own sub cults agendas and aims, to
        get more committee positions and more council positions in order to get closer to the Great Leader's inner
        circle.
    </li>
    <li>
        Happy with the New World. The Host see the past as a barren landscape, the future is a glorious field of
        opportunity to be seized and remade in the right image and there is plenty of time to argue about what that
        image is.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Three Things They Are Not</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Down with the hate speech. Irrespective of where the faith lies, none of The Hosts adherents are on the path of
        hate speech against any group or groups.
    </li>
    <li>
        Internally murderous. While the plots of the Host run deep and twisted, defeating and humiliating your rivals in
        the public eye is what counts, it is agreed that murdering your rivals is not the right way to get ahead.
    </li>
    <li>
        Apocalyptic. None of the many branches of the Host's lunacy have an end game that results in mass suicide or
        further global destruction. That bit has already happened.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Look and Feel</h2>
<p>
    Robes, religious icons, articles of faith, holy items, dramatic slogans, daily or even hourly rituals and rites,
    weird religious practices, a ritual for every occasion, in-fighting and back biting, jockeying for position,
    labyrinthine plots, ritual flim flam, divine apparatus, divination equipment, wards, icons, articles of faith.
</p>

<h3>What To Avoid</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Kit without robes</li>
    <li>Camo gear</li>
    <li>Pointy hoods</li>
    <li>Real-world religious icongraphy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hierarchy</h2>
<p>
    At the apex of the Host is the Divine Leader - never seen, rarely felt - but always obeyed. Beneath this distant but
    absolute authority are a teeming mass of sects and councils whose bickering priests are solely unified by their
    fervent conviction that only through the Divine Leader's transcendent power that humanity might be saved: on how the
    Leader's cryptic signs might be interpreted to that end - there is no consensus.
</p>
<p>
    Foremost amongst these eternally-competing conclaves, churches and sects are the four councils of the Triad of
    Omniscience: four groups that are held in higher esteem than the rest due to their immense followings and seeming
    favour with the Divine Leader. It is a tenuous position - one that only lasts for as long as the sect can draw
    together enough lesser groups in shared belief and divine signs and symbols from the Divine Leader to support their
    standing; the history of the Host is dotted with periods of instability and upheaval caused by the rise and fall of
    these power blocs. At present, the four sects who form the Triad of Omniscience are the followers of the Beale of
    Ian, Daveed Beckingham, the Two Trotters and the Order of Asstraseneca.
</p>
<p>
    When the Host is called to aid in the endeavours of C.R.A.S.S, the eyes, hands and voice of the Divine Leader:
    agents elevated from the clamorous horde of believers by signs and portents interpreted by the Triad of Omniscience.
    These signs mark these individuals as being sent by Divine Leader to speak, act and observe on the godhead's behalf.
    Rumoured to each have powers bestowed upon them by the Divine Leader, they are afforded utmost authority in
    gathering the faithful to overcoming Hot-Zones in the name of the Divine Leader.
</p>

<h2>The Divine Leader</h2>
<p>
    The Divine Leader is an enigmatic and unseen figure who possesses an incredible mastery over life and death - a
    peerless knowledge of medical and pharmacological lore that the faithless of the Wastes might claim to have its
    origins in the libraries of the Old, but which the Host know is divinely inspired. Thousands of lives would have
    been lost or irrevocably changed for the worse if not for the medication provided by the Divine Leader.
</p>
<p>
    Though the Divine Leader's origins are shrouded in rumour, their story is said to have started with a single masked
    entity calling itself "The Will of the Leader", whose deliveries of brown paper bags of medicine to a small
    settlement was all that stood between the inhabitants and a strange and terrible plague. Despite their grave
    situation, and the unlikely hope of a complete stranger being able to prescribe medication for a disease in such
    ignorant times, the medicines allowed every family in the settlement to recover while those who refused the Masked
    One's aid slowly wasted away. This promise of good health in a world of sickness and death - to stave off the
    frailties of the flesh - sparked the beginning of the Host.
</p>
<p>
    As well as divine powers of healing, the Divine Leader is said to be the only one to know the true nature and
    origins of the Ends that ravaged the Old: secrets never to be revealed until the Host as a whole is deemed worthy of
    the knowledge. Thanks to The Divine Leader's closely kept secrets and indifference towards the internal politics of
    their followers, a dizzying number of interpretations of The Divine Leader's will have sprung up in the years since
    the Host's foundation: each claiming some unique insight into the Leader's nature. If any of this displeases the
    Divine Leader - it has yet to be seen.
</p>

<h2>Sects, Cults, Churches, and Congregations</h2>
<p>
    The Unnumbered Host is composed of a myriad of independent councils and sects all jockeying for power and favour in
    the certainty that their interpretation of the Divine Leader's closely guarded secret to the end of days is true.
    While these councils and sects may feud and vigorously debate their crackpot theologies, any and all who practise
    their belief as part of the Unnumbered Host stand united in the ideal that the Divine Leader knows all, and will
    someday reveal their ultimate Truth to the faithful. The Divine Leader gifts the council's and sects of the Host
    sanctuary, sustenance and community, and thus the various bickering sects of the Host will always unite under the
    name of the Unnumbered Host.
</p>
<p>
    In the centuries since the Ends washed away the Before the distinction between religious relic, holy symbol, kitsch
    doodad and soap-opera star has vanished: being swirled into an amorphous dross whose constituent pieces have twisted
    and evolved in the fervent hands of the Host into forms more useful to their vision for the future. Where the
    Wastelanders see exciting junk to set on fire, or the Knights fragments of some Arthurian quest - the Host have
    found a pantheon of strange new deities in the wreckage of the Before. While the councils and sects of the host
    follow their individual deities and gods with absolute devotion, none sit in higher esteem than the Divine Leader
    itself; the only one who can communicate with the many deities celebrated and worshipped by the sects of the
    Unnumbered
</p>

<h2>Mutants and the Unnumbered Host</h2>
<p>
    The Host has long struggled with the question of mutants - or rather, has struggled with the question innumerable
    times in even more different ways as each clade, coven, catechism and congregation has, at various times, has argued
    one way or the other on the topic. Most of these 'intense scripture encounters' have not led to violence - but there
    have been some strongly-worded prayers nailed to the doors of more than one shrine.
</p>
<p>
    This has led to a stark schism within the Host: between those who either see the baseline human genotype as being
    something that should be protected, set as a divine ideal or embraced as 'a pretty cool way to be'; and those who
    believe mutants are the future, that the guiding hand of the Divine Leader can be seen in the modification of the
    genome or that humanity must use these holy technologies to become something more than the featherless bipeds they
    have hitherto shown themselves to be.
</p>
<p>
    As is befitting of the Host - these two halves get along fine: after all, the Divine Leader will warp fate to show
    who is in the right - all in good time. Until then though, there's no reason for congregations on either side of the
    divide not to be haughty, self-assured jackasses to the other. After all, what's the point in eventually being right
    if you can't tell people they're wrong frequently and in creative ways? This divide means that congregations are
    exclusively populated by mutants - or by baseline humans: a fact that they are very pleased with and talk about at
    length.
</p>

<h2>Territory</h2>
<p>
    The Unnumbered Host has a relatively small footprint compared to NuGov and the Knights, owing to their focus on the
    Inner Sanctum: an elegant yet heavily fortified cathedral-turned-fortress said to act as both the hub for the Host
    and the Great Leader's medical laboratory. The Inner Sanctum is riddled with a winding system of catacombs and
    tunnels that house the greatest secrets of the Host, lying deep under the rubble of the city of Glouce's Shire, it
    is shaped as a mighty unblinking eye - or, as heathens might claim - a mint with a hole. It is unclear whether the
    Divine Leader resides among the Inner Sanctum itself, or hides away in one of the many local or distant temples and
    churches scattered across the Gritlands by the Unnumbered Host.
</p>
<p>
    Much of the Inner Sanctum's working parts appear to be automated, or else (as several sub-cults suppose) operate
    under instructions directly from the Divine Leader; the method by which the Great Leader delivers instructions to
    the fortress should he not reside there is, of course, the source of much contention.
</p>

<h2>Role Among The Clans</h2>
<p>
    You can have all the food, water, and raw materials in the world, surround yourself with concrete and barbed wire,
    load your pipe rifle with explosive rounds, and dress yourself in the thickest armour, but if you get an infection,
    catch the flu, or find a colony of psi-mould under your bed, you'll be wishing there was a 24/7 chemist somewhere
    nearby.
</p>
<p>
    The Host knows medicine, it knows chemicals, and it knows drugs. The Host not only receives direction from the the
    Divine Leader, but also clean and reliable prescriptions from their enigmatic ruler.
</p>
<p>
    The composition and theory of these meds is largely lost to time, and no one but the Host has the patience or
    comprehension to deal with the Divine Leader's strange requests and prerequisites. Sure enough, however, at the end
    of every calendar month, the Divine Leader provides an enormous bounty of chems and meds in paper bags with the
    intended recipient's name and home address on. The medicine always works, the dosage is always appropriate to the
    symptoms, injury, or illness, and the Host's drug-fuelled raves are always legendary.
