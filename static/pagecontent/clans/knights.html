<h1>Knights of the Realm</h1>

<h2>Who Are They Knights of the Realm?</h2>
<p>
    Dedicated to peacekeeping and a strict moral code, the Knights of the Realm hold fast to the romanticised ideals of
    a medieval Britain and it's mysterious history. Their belief system and society is inspired by the tales, history
    and folklore of the Arthurian myths
</p>

<h3>Three Things They Are</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Goodies, the Knights of the Realm are good people trying to do good in an awful world. They will genuinely go
        out of their way to undertake good and altruistic acts.
    </li>
    <li>
        They believe that the only way to survive in the New World is to go back to a simpler, less materialistic
        lifestyle and are not obsessed with material possessions, prestige, and vanity (unless you count elevating
        humility to an art form).
    </li>
    <li>
        Straight talking, they aren't interested in politics, back stabbing or machinations.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Three Things They Are Not</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Zealots. The knights are not fanatical D&D Paladins committed to good at all costs on a quest to banish evil
        with extreme prejudice.
    </li>
    <li>
        Edgelords. They also don't have any "secret baddies" who break the rules when no one is looking, no plausible
        deniability. They are genuinely goodies. Yes, all of them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reenactors. The Knights are not actually out to recreate any form of genuine medieval society.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Look And Feel</h2>
<p>
    Battered, graffiti-covered plate armour, medieval style armour, pub signs for shields, simple tabards made from old
    shell suits, matching livery for groups and orders with specific duties, medieval style weaponry, UK brands as
    heraldry, medieval style clothes made from modern materials.
</p>
<h3>What To Avoid</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Camo gear / military uniforms</li>
    <li>Recycled sports kit</li>
    <li>Actual medieval kit</li>
    <li>'Tribal' stuff</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hierarchy</h2>
<p>
    When the Rust Knight left to continue her quest to restore the ruins of the Now, they saw fit to leave the matter of
    leadership to her Knights: when discussion failed to progress beyond deciding on the seating plan for the Round
    Table, one Knight - who had been the Rust Knight's very own squire - suggested they consult the tomes of lore that
    the Rust Knight had used to shape their society. While that didn't end up going anywhere, it was agreed that
    "reading the manual" was just the sort of forward-thinking the Realm needed and thus the Knight was elected to be
    the first Monarch.
</p>
<p>
    Ever since, Monarchs have been elected by the High Table - the, well, highest of all circular tables whose members
    are themselves elected by the Low Tables of each settlement who have sworn the Rust Knight's oath and joined the
    Realm. An election is held whenever the reigning Monarch dies, or completes the mandate they petitioned for the
    crown on.
</p>
<p>
    When C.R.A.S.S requests the Realm's aid, the Monarch's High Marshall and Chamberlain are tasked with a Royal Quest
    and are vested with the Monarch's power in collecting heroes from across the Realm to ensure victory.
</p>

<h2>Anachronism and Technophobia</h2>
<p>
    The Knights are guided by the tomes of lore and learning brought to the first among them by the Rust Knight: these
    soft backed histories detail a time before the End, without Scars where heroes protected the innocent and goodness
    and fairness was the right of all. Other books within this library describe farming, animal husbandry, nutrition and
    nearly 500 different ways to use a tomato and while even the most studious magi have only attempted a few of these
    curious preparations it is assured that number 313 will surprise them.
</p>
<p>
    Through this initial fantastical mediaeval lens, the people of the Realm have found a way to make sense of the
    deeply bizarre and bewildering state of the world: they quest for the relics needed to purify the world; they battle
    evil wherever they find it be it mutated monster, nano-spawned spirit or robotic golem and remain vigilant against
    the malign forces that divided the people of the Before so that the End will never be repeated.
</p>
<p>
    This vigilance manifests as a deep suspicion of Oldtek and tools and techniques that detract from the "nobility" of
    working the land and curing its sicknesses: where running water, fertilisers and medicines have been embraced (once
    filtered through the world-view of the Realm), central heating, wireless communications and belt-loops have been
    wholly rejected as risking a return to the mistakes of the past.
</p>

<h2>Oaths and Symbols</h2>
<p>
    For a Knight and so by extension every inhabitant of the Realm, one's word is their bond: from the lowest farmer to
    the Monarch themselves, the swearing of oaths is a solemn vow only broken by villains and killjoys - to say that you
    will do something and then just let the side down is an unforgivable offence - one that of course necessitates a
    swearing of another vow of contrition. It also can be something of a pain when there are fields of crops to be dug
    up, but the farmers won't start until a suitably important official is present to hear them swear to uproot their
    swede-shaped foes.
</p>
<p>
    What weight would an oath have if not sworn upon a suitable symbol? Existing in a world awash with the forgotten
    iconography of a dead era, the Realm have chosen to reappropriate the symbology of the before to suit their need for
    Knightly arms and heraldry. Emblems representing the world of plenty that the Rust Knight fought for are favoured,
    with qualities like a nourishing character, fortifying skill at arms or a hearty, robust flavour of deeds being
    especially popular. But any scrap of the Old that speaks to farmer, Knight, Page or Alchemist is likely to be
    incorporated into their standing amongst the culture of the Realm.
</p>

<h2>Mutants and Knights of the Realm</h2>
<p>
    In some stories the Rust Knight was a mutant - in others, she is a baseline human. The scriptures they imparted onto
    the clan are otherwise soggy and inconclusive on the matter.
</p>
<p>
    Overall however, the genetic makeup of a Knight, Serf, Magi or Scout is secondary to their skill and passion for the
    defence of the realm, their talent at driving an ox, mastery of the forge and dedication to the future the Rust
    Knight bought with blood and toil.
</p>
<p>
    The ancient myths and legends from the Before that are the lifeblood of the Knight's culture mention figures who
    blended human and inhuman features: warriors with horns or wings, mysterious sages with the eyes of an owl - what
    could these be, the loremasters say, if not mutants? This predilection towards legendary figures has led to many
    aspiring Knight Errants to seek to adopt a defining mutation to embiggen their cromulent tale-in-the-making!
</p>
<p>
    Across the Realm the only prejudice (of a sort) against mutants that is widely held is a disdain for mutations that
    are so ostentatious or impractical as to impede one's duty. Such showy, self-serving modifications are looked upon
    dimly as wasteful indulgences.
</p>

<h2>Territory</h2>
<p>
    The Realm is a scattered collection of settlements and fortifications that protect hard-won scrapes of arable land
    from the sterile, monster-haunted wastes; these points of light against an apocalyptic darkness are joined by the
    Roads: well-trod pathways cleared by sword and shooter and protected by endlessly-questing Knights and their
    retinues.
</p>
<p>
    At the heart of the Realm there is the Castle: a majestic edifice of the Before whose grand galleries and varied
    chambers contain all manner of wonders and relics. The Castle is where the Rust Knight led the first people of the
    Realms - showing them the mysteries of the freezer section, the secret of canned goods and how nourishment could be
    coaxed from the wreckage of the garden centre. Today these sites are shrines of learning, safe behind the reinforced
    bulwarks erected around the park of cars.
</p>

<h2>Role Among The Clans</h2>
<p>
    If anyone knows farming, it's the Round Table. Someone, at some point, presumably found a textbook on medieval
    society and agriculture, thought it would be a good way to cope with the challenges of the apocalypse, and revived
    an old way of life
</p>
<p>
    When compared to the lands of the other Clans, the Realm is the most fertile. Their sceptical approach to technology
    means the Round Table's methods are careful, methodical, sustainable, and clean. Badly-mutated or contaminated crops
    are quarantined and segregated; crops and livestock are rotated in a manner that maximises yield by promoting
    efficient use of land and the proper recovery of nutrients to the soil. The Round Table receives regular shipments
    of water from NuGov, using it with measured care and consideration to ensure that every drop is accounted for and
    used where it is needed most.
</p>
<p>
    The administration behind the division and allocation of farmland, the value of crops and produce, and labour
    provided at harvest time, is beyond the other clans but comes naturally to the Round Table. On the surface the Round
    Table appears to be about chivalry and oaths and good manners, but beneath that they have developed an agrarian
    ideal in which everyone's home is their castle, everyone has a garden, every garden has a tree, and everyone shares
    in a potluck drawn from a thousand allotments.
</p>

<h2>Why Play A Knight?</h2>
<p class="pink_text">
    You should play in the Knights of the Realm if you like being humble yet sanctimonious, fighting evil and protecting
    the weak.
