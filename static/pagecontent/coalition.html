<h1>The Coalition</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        Four diverse clans exist in a state of mutual benefit
    </li>
    <li>
        Each clan provides something that the other three need
    </li>
    <li>
        Regulated trade occurs between clan territories
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The diversity of these clans might provoke someone of a 21st Century mindset to ask “why do they not fall into
    competition with each other?” or “what is keeping one clan from taking everything for themselves?” or “if they're so
    different, why don't they fight each other, invade each others' territory, or stab each other in the back?” Ironic
    as it may seem, those questions come from the psyche of someone who does not have a survivor's mindset; they come
    from the mind of someone brought up in a greedy, capitalist world of plenty. The true survivors, the hard-bitten
    dwellers of the future wasteland, know that survival has nothing to do with eradicating the competition; it's about
    embracing diversity and working together to accomplish that which you would struggle to do alone.
</p>
<p>
    The clans don't fight each other because there is nothing to gain from doing so; they would risk losing everything
    in exchange for an existence much more arduous than their present circumstances.
</p>
<p>
    The four clans have formed a larger society that, while not quite harmonious, is beneficial to everyone in it. The
    world has been severely depopulated, so there is more than enough room for everyone; those who wish to elevate
    themselves by stepping on the backs of others will quickly find themselves bereft of allies, wandering the
    wastelands alone, regret their only companion.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, there are plenty of people out in the wastes who don't embrace this cooperative mindset; cannibals,
    conquerers, raiders, destroyers, nihilists, and small-minded warlords set on writing their own plaque like that of
    Ozymandias.
</p>
<p>
    Finally there are the those who are independent, stubborn, or remote enough that, despite their otherwise positive
    demeanour, are not part of the clans' conglomerate; these smaller clans, tribes, caravans, and communities make up
    the “locals” in areas beyond the four clans' territories.
