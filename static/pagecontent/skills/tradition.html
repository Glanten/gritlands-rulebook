    <!-- WITNESS STUFF -->
    <strong>Wastelander Tradition</strong>
    <p>
        You have chronicled the Heroes, now you must tell their story.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes known as "Record, Rewind, Replay", this tradition has two parts: <em>responding</em> to a call to
        witness, and <em>recounting</em> the deeds you have witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any Wastelander character may call for other Wastelanders to witness their deeds and actions with an appropriate
        shout of “Watch this!” “Observe” “Get a load of this!” Or even “Witness!” If an Enabler responds appropriately,
        the character who called for witnesses regains GRIT equal to the Enabler's Reputation level (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Reputation 1</strong>: “Camera ONE rolling” - the Wastelander who called for your attention regains 1
        GRIT.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Reputation 2</strong>: “Ready for a TWO Shot” - the Wastelander who called for your attention regains 2
        GRIT.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reputation 3</strong>: “Prying open my THIRD Eye” - the Wastelander who called for your attention
        regains 3 GRIT.
    </p>
    <p>
        To recount the deeds you have witnessed, you may spend 5 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to narrate the deeds
        you have been called to witness. Every Wastelander character who stops to listen to the entire story (cheering,
        pumping their fists, slapping their thighs, etc.) regains 1 GRIT. If the Wastelander you are telling the story
        about is present, that individual gains an extra 1 GRIT. This retelling may not be performed in the HOTZONE.
    </p>

    <strong>Level 1</strong>
    <p>
        You can respond to a maximum of 5 calls to witness per day.
    </p>

        You can recount one witnessed deed per day.
    </p>

    <strong>Level 2</strong>
    <p>
        You can respond to a maximum of 10 calls to witness per day.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can recount an extra witnessed deed every day.
    </p>

    <strong>Level 3</strong>
    <p>
        You can respond to a maximum of 15 calls to witness per day.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can recount yet another witnessed deed every day.

    <!-- OATHS STUFF -->
    <strong>Knights of the Realm Tradition</strong>
    <p>
        You may record and adjudicate the completion of Oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
        Knights may swear Oaths to you. It is up to you to determine that they are suitable oaths. If they are, you
        may record them in the Book of Oaths. The character that swore the oath gains GRIT equal to your Reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
        No Knights of the Realm character may have more active oaths than the higher of their ...& Chewing Gum or
        Reputation skill.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you announce that an Oath has been fulfilled (see below), the swearer of that Oath gains GRIT equal to the
        sum of your Reputation and their Reputation. They may then grant the same amount of GRIT to their fellow Knights
        (maximum 1 GRIT per knight) who were present at, or instrumental to, the completion of that Oath.
    </p>

    <strong>Level 1</strong>
    <p>
        Once per day, you may announce that Oaths have been fulfilled. The number of Oaths announced must not exceed
        your Reputation skill.
    </p>

    <strong>Level 2</strong>
    <p>
        Twice per day, you may announce that Oaths have been fulfilled. Each time, the number of Oaths announced must
        not exceed your Reputation skill.
    </p>

    <strong>Level 3</strong>
    <p>
        Thrice per day, you may announce that Oaths have been fulfilled. Each time, the number of Oaths announced must
        not exceed your Reputation skill.
    </p>

    <h3>Pronouncement of Oaths Talents</h3>

    <strong>Glory, Glory! (1 skill point)</strong>
    <p>
        Once per day, upon witnessing the completion of an Oath sworn to you in a HOTZONE, you may immediately announce
        the Oath's completion. This does not count towards your daily announcement limit.
    </p>

    <strong>In Memoriam (1 skill point)</strong>
    <p>
        If a character fulfils an Oath sworn by a now-deceased member of their Group, you may choose to bestow the GRIT

    <strong>Unnumbered Host Tradition</strong>
    <p>
        You are trenchant in your faith, crystal clear in your vision, and LOUD in your words.
    </p>
    <p>
        Delivering a sermon requires 5 minutes of appropriate roleplaying, delivering the truth of your specific
        beliefs. Another Preacher may then challenge your sermon with their own 5 minute response; they may, in turn, be
        challenged by another Preacher, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once all sermons and challenges have been completed, every attending character who is part of your Group regains
        GRIT equal to your Reputation. Every attending Host character (inlcuding characters from your Group) also gains
        1 GRIT for every preacher who was involved in the sermons and challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unless stated otherwise, sermons and challenges may not be performed in the HOTZONE.
    </p>

    <strong>Level 1</strong>
    <p>
        You can deliver one sermon per day. You may make as many challenges to another Preacher's sermons as you wish.

    <strong>Level 3</strong>
    <p>
        You can deliver three sermon per day! You may make as many challenges to another Preacher's sermons as you wish.

    <strong>Staff of Office (1 skill point)</strong>
    <p>
        You have the ability to wield a unique Smashy or Pokey weapon that you otherwise would not be able to use. That
        weapon must take the form of a religious icon appropriate for your character's beliefs. You may change the
        specific weapon by performing a 5 minute rite (prayers, meditation, chanting, etc).
    </p>

    <strong>Syncretist (1 skill point)</strong>

        Once per day, you may consider another Group to be part of your Group when restoring GRIT from a sermon.
    </p>

    <strong>Populist (1 skill point)</strong>
