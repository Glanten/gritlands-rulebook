    <!-- WITNESS STUFF -->
    <strong>Wastelander Tradition</strong>
    <p>
        You have chronicled the Heroes, now you must tell their story.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes known as "Record, Rewind, Replay", this tradition has two parts: <em>responding</em> to a call to
        witness, and <em>recounting</em> the deeds you have witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any Wastelander character may call for other Wastelanders to witness their deeds and actions with an appropriate
        shout of “Watch this!” “Observe” “Get a load of this!” Or even “Witness!” It is up to an Enabler to respond.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Response is based on the Enabler's level in this skill
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Level 1</strong>: “Camera ONE rolling” - the Wastelander who called for your attention regains 1 GRIT.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Level 2</strong>: “Ready for a TWO Shot” - the Wastelander who called for your attention regains 2 GRIT.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Level 3</strong>: “Prying open my THIRD Eye” - the Wastelander who called for your attention regains 3
        GRIT.
    </p>
    <p>
        To recount the deeds you have witnessed, you may spend 5 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to narrate the deeds
        you have been called to witness. Every Wastelander character who stops to listen to the entire story (cheering,
        pumping their fists, slapping their thighs, etc.) regains 1 GRIT. If the Wastelander you are telling the story
        about is present, that individual gains an extra 1 GRIT. This retelling may not be performed in the HOTZONE.
    </p>

    <strong>Level 1</strong>
    <p>
        You can respond to a maximum of 5 calls to witness per day.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can recount one witnessed deed per day.
    </p>

    <strong>Level 2</strong>
    <p>
        You can respond to a maximum of 10 calls to witness per day.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can recount an extra witnessed deed every day.
    </p>

    <strong>Level 3</strong>
    <p>
        You can respond to a maximum of 15 calls to witness per day.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can recount yet another witnessed deed every day.
    </p>

    <h3>Witness Talents</h3>

    <strong>Cohost (1 skill point)</strong>
    <p>
        By spending 3 GRIT, you can assist another Broadcaster in their recounting. They must lead for the majority of

    </p>
