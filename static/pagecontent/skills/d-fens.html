<p>
    Stopping people from pushing sharp, dangerous objects through you is an essential ability. We recommend the barrier
    method.
</p>

<strong>Level 1</strong>
<!-- this needs a verbal to signal to the aggressor that their call has been resisted and cannot be repeated! -->
<p>
    Once per day you can resist a weapon call (the player / NPC making the call doesn't spend GRIT but cannot repeat the
    call for 5 seconds).
</p>

<strong>Level 2</strong>
<p>
    Twice per day you can resist a weapon call (the player / NPC making the call doesn't spend GRIT but cannot repeat
    the
    call for 5 seconds).
</p>

<strong>Level 3</strong>
<p>
    Thrice per day you can resist a weapon call (the player / NPC making the call doesn't spend GRIT but cannot repeat
    the call for 5 seconds).
</p>

<h2>D-Fens Talents</h2>

<h3>'Eavy Metal (1 skill point)</h3>
<!-- warpaint rules need clarifying -->
<p>
    You can wear heavy armour (i.e. 'Eavy Metal). It provides 2 additional GRIT (cumulative with War Paint).
</p>

<h3>Shield (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    You can use a shield.
</p>

<h3>I am Iron Man (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    You must be a Warrior or an Engineer.
</p>
<p>
    If you are wearing 'Eavy Metal, it provides 1 additional GRIT.
</p>

<h3>Bulletproof (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    You must be a Warrior.
</p>
<p>
    If you are wearing 'Eavy Metal, you may spend 1 GRIT to avoid Grievous Harm from a firearm as if it was a melee
    weapon or bow/crossbow hit by taking a strike-down effect. Each level of D-Fens gives you one use of this ability
    per day.

        We almost didn't include these abilities, because having <em>your</em> jam trump <em>my</em> jam isn't much fun.
        Gritlands isn't intended to be a PVP game; this skill means you might need to think about when and how you
        deploy your weapon calls if you get into a scrap with another player (as you do not spend the GRIT if the effect
        is not taken).

    <p class="pink_text">
        What we absolutely will not do is routinely give resistance skills to the general opposition. Instead, we might
        give a limited subset of the opposition limited resistances where it makes narrative sense (if it's using its
        claws and horns to gouge you, you can't disarm it. If it is a 2 ton automated defence turret you can't strike it
        down, etc.)
