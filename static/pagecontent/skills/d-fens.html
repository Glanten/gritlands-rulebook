    Stopping people from pushing sharp, dangerous objects through you is an essential ability. We recommend the barrier
    method.
</p>

<strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        Once per day you can resist a weapon call (the player / NPC making the call doesn't spend GRIT but cannot repeat
        the call for 5 seconds).
    </li>
</ul>

<strong>Level 2</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        Twice per day you can resist a weapon call (the player / NPC making the call doesn't spend GRIT but cannot
        repeat the call for 5 seconds).
    </li>
</ul>

<strong>Level 3</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        Thrice per day you can resist a weapon call (the player / NPC making the call doesn't spend GRIT but cannot
        repeat the call for 5 seconds).
    </li>
</ul>

        We almost didn't include these abilities, because having your jam trump my jam isn't much fun. Gritlands isn't
        intended to be a PVP game, if you get in a scrap with another player - this skill means you might need to think
        about when you deploy your weapon calls, but cannot counter them entirely (as you do not spend the grit if the
        effect is not taken).
    </p>
    <p class="pink_text">
        What we absolutely will not do is routinely give resistance skills to the general opposition. We might give a
        limited subset of the opposition limited resistances where it makes narrative sense (if it's using its claws and
        horns to gouge you, you can't disarm it. If it is a 2 ton Automated defence turret you can't strike it down.)
