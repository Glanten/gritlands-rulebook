<h3>Scavenger (1 skill point)</h3>

    Each time you come out of the Hot Zone you will have gathered one random resource per level of the Scout skill you
    have.
</p>

<h3>Picklock (1 skill point per level)</h3>
<p>Your levels in Picklock cannot exceed your levels in the base Scout skill</p>
<p>You can undertake Lock Pick TASKS.</p>

<h3>Evaluate (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    You can open a Resources case to see what is inside whilst inside a Hot Zone. You may not take (or interact with)
    the
    contents until the container is opened normally.
</p>
<p>
    Note that this essentially lets you peek into a container to ascertain if it is worth spending the time and
    resources
    necessary to open it properly.

<h3>Applied with a Trowel (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    Your Warpaint provides you an additional 1 GRIT.
</p>

<h3>Street Sweepers (1 Skill point)</h3>
<p>
    You can use Street Sweeper firearms.
</p>

<h3>Dirty fighting (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    You may use this ability twice per day. If your opponent is “down” (i.e. neither foot flat on the floor), and you
    are
    using a weapon under 24” in you can spend 1 point of GRIT to call “MAIM”. This inflicts 1 point of GRIEVOUS HARM
    which the opponent cannot spend GRIT to avoid. (NPCs should show immediate sign of having suffered a consequence -
    if they do not then you retain the GRIT you would have spent).
