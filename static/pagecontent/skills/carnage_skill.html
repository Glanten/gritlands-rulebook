<h1>Carnage</h1>
<p>
  <strong>Archetype Skill</strong>
</p>
<p>
  You are highly trained in the arts of breaking the human body, and stopping people from breaking yours. Many of these
  principles carry over very effectively when used against near-human and non-human foes.
</p>
<p>
  The Carnage skill allows you to dish out some serious damage and gives you access to melee weapon calls that can make
  you even more effective in combat. It can also make you tankier, allowing you to withstand harm in combat, and
  synergises well with the D-Fens, Never Say Die, and True Grit skills.
