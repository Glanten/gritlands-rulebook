    The Gritlands are tough: injury and hazard are constant companions. So it is unsurprising that you have learned how
    to patch up quite serious wounds, at least enough to get back to safety.
</p>
<p>
    FOCUS: The first aid skill requires you to have an appropriate physrep first aid kit. This kit must be used as part
    of your appropriate roleplaying.
</p>

<strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        Once per day you can Treat a Minor Consequence with 2 minutes of roleplay. The character can ignore the negative
        effects of the consequence (the consequence slot remains filled).
    </li>
    <li>
        You can treat additional Minor consequences each day for 1 GRIT each.
    </li>
    <li>
        For 2 points of GRIT you can treat a Moderate consequence with 2 minutes of roleplay. The character can ignore
        the negative effects of the consequence for 30 minutes (the consequence slot remains filled).
    </li>
    <li>
        For 3 points of GRIT you can treat a Major Consequence with 2 minutes of roleplay. The character can ignore the
        negative effects of the consequence for 30 minutes (the consequence slot remains filled, the consequence is not
        stabilised and will continue to worsen towards the CRITICAL).
    </li>
    <li>
        You may treat your own Minor Consequences at the cost of 1 additional GRIT (you cannot treat your own
        consequences for free).
