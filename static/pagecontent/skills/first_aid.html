<h1>First Aid</h1>

<p>
    The Gritlands are tough: injury and hazard are constant companions. So it is unsurprising that you have learned how
    to patch up quite serious wounds, at least enough to get back to safety.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Skill Focus</strong>: A (relatively) clean and well-stocked first aid kit.
</p>
<p>
    First Aid is a restorative skill that allows your patient to ignore the negative effects of a Consequence, but does
    not remove said Consequence the way the Medic skill does. Unlike the Medic skill, however, First Aid does not
    require a field hospital, so you can use First Aid almost anywhere (like in a HOTZONE) to get someone back on their
    feet, giving them the opportunity to return to calmer surroundings where they might receive a more permanent medical
    solution.
</p>

<strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        You may spend 1 GRIT and engage in 2 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to treat a Minor (Physical) Consequence.
        After treatment, the recipient can ignore the negative effects of the Consequence (although the consequence slot
        remains filled). There is no GRIT cost for this skill the first time you use it on a given day.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may treat your own Minor (Physical) Consequences at an additional cost of 1 GRIT. You may not use your free
        daily uses of First Aid to treat your own Consequences.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may spend 2 GRIT and engage in 2 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to treat a Moderate (Physical)
        Consequence. After treatment, the recipient can ignore the negative effects of the Consequence for 30 minutes
        (although the consequence slot remains filled).
    </li>
    <li>
        You may spend 3 GRIT and engage in 2 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to treat a Major (Physical) Consequence.
        After treatment, the recipient can ignore the negative effects of the Consequence for 30 minutes (although the
        consequence slot remains filled; the Consequence is not stabilised and will continue to worsen towards a
        Critical Consequence).
    </li>
</ul>

<strong>Level 2</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        As level 1 plus:
    </li>
    <li>
        You may treat your own Moderate (Physical) Consequences at an additional cost of 1 GRIT. You may not use your
        free daily uses of First Aid to treat your own Consequences.
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain an additional free daily use of this skill to treat Minor (Physical) Consequences.
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain a free daily use of this skill to treat Moderate (Physical) Consequences.
    </li>
</ul>

<strong>Level 3</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        As level 2 plus:
    </li>
    <li>
        You may treat your own Major (Physical) Consequences at an additional cost of 1 GRIT. You may not use your free
        daily uses of First Aid to treat your own Consequences. Just as with your patients, while you may ignore the
        negative effects of the Consequence, the Consequence is still there and will progress to a Critical Consequence
        if not cured (normally by the Medic skill).
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain yet another free daily use of this skill to treat Minor (Physical) Consequences.
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain another free daily use of this skill to treat Moderate (Physical) Consequences.
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain a free daily use of this skill to treat Major (Physical) Consequences.
    </li>
</ul>
