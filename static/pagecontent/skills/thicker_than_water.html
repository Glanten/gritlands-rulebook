    In the wasteland your first, last and best survival tool is your group, or possibly a G2000 Slaughter Bot. But who
    can find one of those in good condition with less than 1,500 kills on the clock?
</p>
<p>
    Thicker Than Water lets you redistribute a limited amount of GRIT between members of your Group. This might give an
    otherwise-exhausted Engineer just enough pep to perform a crucial TASK, give a Warrior the strength to open a sealed
    chamber, or empower scientist to save a comrade's life despite extreme pressure.
</p>

<strong>Level 1</strong>
<p>
    You may lead a ritual involving 2 minutes of appropriate roleplaying with members of your Group. All participants
    may donate up to 1 GRIT to a central pool; this pool can then be granted to one recipient in your Group.
</p>
<p>
    All characters involved in this rite must be present, must have the Thicker Than Water skill, and must agree to the
    redistribution.
</p>

<strong>Level 2</strong>
<p>
    As Level 1 except each participant may donate up to 2 GRIT to the pool.
</p>

<strong>Level 3</strong>
<p>
    As Level 1 except each participant may donate up to 3 GRIT to the pool.
