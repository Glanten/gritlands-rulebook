<h1>Psychoanalysis</h1>

    If we were but unfeeling sacks of flesh we'd feel much more at home in the Hot Zones: but alas, we see, we feel - we
    remember. Understanding, accepting and mastering the horrors of the Gritlands isn't merely a 'nice to have' - it's a
    necessity.

<p>
    <strong>Skill Focus</strong>: A therapy room including two seats, privacy, and (relative) quiet.
</p>
<p>
    Psychoanalysis is very similar to the Medic skill but it heals mental maladies instead of physical injuries. HOTZONE
    hazards are commonly physical (radiation, nanites, traps, mutants, toxic gas, etc.) but explorers are often stumble
    from such places beset by stress, fear, despair, and weird psychological effects that no amount of bandages can fix.

<strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        You may spend 1 GRIT and engage in 2 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to treat a Minor (Psyche) Consequence.
        This treatment removes the Consequence entirely from the patient. There is no GRIT cost for this skill the first
        time you use it on a given day.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may spend 2 GRIT and engage in 5 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to treat a Moderate (Psyche)
        Consequence. This treatment removes the Consequence entirely from the patient.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may spend 3 GRIT and engage in 5 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to treat a Major (Psyche) Consequence,
        so long as it has been stabilised. This treatment removes the Consequence entirely from the patient.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may spend 3 GRIT and attempt to stabilise a Major (Psyche) Consequence with a series of bead-pulls. 3
        successful bead-pulls stabilises the Consequence, whereas 3 unsuccessful bead-pulls worsens the condition to a
        Critical Consequence. You must engage in 1 minute of appropriate roleplaying between each bead-pull.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may spend 3 GRIT and attempt to stabilise a Critical (Psyche) Consequence with a series of bead-pulls. 3
        successful bead-pulls stabilises the Consequence, whereas 3 unsuccessful bead-pulls will inflict a Terminal
        condition on the character (at this point their fate is sealed and there is nothing more you can do for them).
        You must engage in 1 minute of appropriate roleplaying between each bead-pull.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may not use this skill to treat your own Consequences.
    </li>
</ul>

<strong>Level 2</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        As level 1 plus:
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain an additional free daily use of this skill to treat Minor (Psyche) Consequences.
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain a free daily use of this skill to treat a Moderate (Psyche) Consequence.
    </li>
    <li>
        You still may not use this skill to treat your own Consequences.
    </li>
</ul>

<strong>Level 3</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        As level 2 plus:
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain another free daily use of this skill to treat Minor (Psyche) Consequences.
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain a second free daily use of this skill to treat a Moderate (Psyche) Consequence.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once per day you may perform one of the following actions with the normal time and roleplaying requirements, but
        with no GRIT cost or bead-pull:
        <ul>
            <li>Treat a stabilised Major (Psyche) Consequence</li>
            <li>Stabilise a Major (Psyche) Consequence</li>
            <li>Stabilise a Critical (Psyche) Consequence</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Without a special talent that lets you ignore this rule, there is no way to use this skill to heal your own
        Consequences.
    </li>
</ul>
