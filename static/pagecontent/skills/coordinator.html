<h1>Coordinator</h1>
<p>
    <strong>Everypony</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You are good at organising disparate teams towards a common goal.
</p>
<p>
    If there are multiple TASKS occuring at the same time and you can roleplay appropriately with all of the
    participants involved, you may spend 1 GRIT to add 1 GRIT to each of the TASKS being performed, even if you wouldn't
    normally be able to assist with the TASK at hand. This can be done a limited number of times per day (see below).
</p>
<p>
    Essentially, Coordinator allows you to assist with multiple TASKS but only pay the GRIT cost of assisting with a
    single TASK.
</p>

<strong>Level 1</strong>
<p>
    You can use Coordinator once per day.
</p>

<strong>Level 2</strong>
<p>
    You can use Coordinator twice per day.
</p>

<strong>Level 3</strong>
<p>
    You can use Coordinator thrice per day.
