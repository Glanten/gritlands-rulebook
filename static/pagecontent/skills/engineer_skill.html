<h1>Engineer Skill</h1>
<p>
    <strong>Archetype, Professional</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You can make things, repair things, maintain things. You have hard won and ancient knowledge relating to mechanics,
    electronics, architecture, material sciences... even engines, computers, programming, and more!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Skill Focus</strong>: Tool kit and/or workbench.
</p>
<p>
    Engineering allows you to craft items by combining raw materials (normally recovered from a HOTZONE) and blueprints
    (that your character has learned or researched). It also allows you to interact with electrical and mechanical
    elements in the world, which is a very valuable skill to have in HOTZONES that were once functional facilities from
    the beforetimes.

<h2>Engineering Talents</h2>

<h3>Additional Recipes (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    You may take this talent once for every level of the Engineering skill you have.
</p>
<p>
    Every time you take this talent, you gain 2 additional Engineering recipes.
</p>

<h3>Scrap hoarder (1 Skill point)</h3>
<!-- I don't understand the wording here; do recipes have levels, or does it mean per level of the Engineering skill? -->
<!-- proposed alternative, if I understand the rules, below:
    <p>
        For every level of the Engineering skill you have, recipes you work on cost you 1 less Scrap.
    <p>
-->
<p>
    You spend 1 less Scrap per level of the recipe you are working on.
</p>

<h3>Mechanical Genius (1 Skill point)</h3>
<p>
    You make Engineering TASK bead pulls at advantage (pull twice and take the better result).
</p>

<h3>Maintainer (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    This talent may be taken a maximum of 3 times.
</p>
<p>
    You generate 1 additional maintenance TAG at the start of every event.
</p>

<h3>Recycle (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    With 2 minutes of appropriate roleplay, you may break down a THING in order to reclaim some resources used in its
    construction. The THING'S lammie should contain the relevant information. This process destroys the original item.
