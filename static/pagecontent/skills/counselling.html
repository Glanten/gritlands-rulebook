    The Gritlands aren't just physically threatening and demanding. They take their toll on the mind as well. Those
    with the empathy and strength to support others are essential in driving society forward in the face of
    adversity. Without these counsellors, nihilism and despair would all too easily quench human (and near-human)
    spirit.
</p>
<p>
    Counselling is a healing skill that allows your patient to ignore the negative effects of psych-type Consequences.
    It does not remove Consequences (use Psychoanalysis for that) but it can act as a quick fix when you need a fellow
    troubleshooter to get back on their feet and stop jumping at shadows in the middle of a HOTZONE.
</p>

<strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        You may spend 1 GRIT and engage in 2 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to treat a Minor (Psyche) Consequence.
        After treatment, the recipient can ignore the negative effects of the Consequence (although the consequence slot
        remains filled). There is no GRIT cost for this skill the first time you use it on a given day.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may spend 2 GRIT and engage in 2 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to treat a Moderate (Psyche)
        Consequence. After treatment, the recipient can ignore the negative effects of the Consequence for 30 minutes
        (although the consequence slot remains filled).
    </li>
    <li>
        You may spend 3 GRIT and engage in 2 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to treat a Major (Psyche)
        Consequence. After treatment, the recipient can ignore the negative effects of the Consequence for 30 minutes
        (although the consequence slot remains filled; the Consequence is not stabilised and will continue to worsen
        towards a Critical Consequence).
    </li>
    <li>
        You may not use Counselling to treat your own Consequences.
    </li>
</ul>

<strong>Level 2</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        As level 1 plus:
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain an additional free daily use of this skill to treat Minor (Psyche) Consequences.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may spend 2 GRIT and engage in 2 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to treat a Minor (Psyche) Consequence
        you have suffered, in the same way as you would treat another character. You cannot employ one of your free
        daily uses of Counselling when treating yourself (i.e. treating yourself always costs GRIT).
    </li>
</ul>

<strong>Level 3</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        As level 2 plus:
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain yet another additional free daily use of this skill to treat Minor (Psyche) Consequences.
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain a free daily use of this skill to treat Moderate (Psyche) Consequences.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may spend 3 GRIT and engage in 2 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to treat a Moderate (Psyche) Consequence
        you have suffered, in the same way as you would treat another character. You cannot employ one of your free
        daily uses of Counselling when treating yourself (i.e. treating yourself always costs GRIT).
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Hey! It's me, it's me! (1 skill point)</h3>

</p>

<h3>Ask for Help (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    Requires Counselling at level 2.
</p>
<p>
    If you can speak with a member of your group as part of your appropriate roleplaying, you can reduce the cost of
    treating your own Minor (Psyche) Consequence by 1 GRIT.
</p>

<h3>Self Help Group (1 skill point)</h3>
<!-- this needs clear and careful wording -->
<p>
    Each level of Counselling allows you to simultaneously treat 1 extra player, increasing the treatment time by 1
    minute for each patient beyond the first, but with no additional GRIT cost. If you have the "Ask for Help" talent,
    you may also treat yourself in this manner (note that this is the cheapest way to treat your own Psyche
    Consequences!). All patients in the group (including yourself if appropriate) must have suffered their Consequences
    from the same source.
</p>
<p>
    When determining whether the source of a group's Consequences is the same, consider the following questions: were
    the Consequences gained during the same encounter? Are they from the same environmental hazard? Has everyone
    developed the same (or similar) phobia/s? Are they presenting the same symptoms and behavioural quirks? Do they all
    have the same type of referee-issued TAG?
</p>

    Requires the Counselling skill at level 3.

<p>
    Three times per day, you may invoke your hard-earned experience as a counsellor as part of your appropriate
    roleplaying for this skill. If you do so, reduce the GRIT expenditure for this treatment by 1 (to a minimum of 1
    GRIT).
