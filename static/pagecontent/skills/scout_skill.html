<h1>Scout Skill</h1>
<p>
    <strong>Archetype, Professional</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You can read the signs in the wind, the taste on the air, identify the flora and fauna of the Gritlands and you know
    where it thrives. You can read the tell tale signs left behind by the occupants and inhabitants of an area, you can
    follow tracks and identify the debris and patterns of many Gritlands Denizens.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Skill Focus</strong>: scout-like trappings that embrace the outdoors such as binoculars, environmental
    survey device, theodolite, a dowsing rod, jars of earth, herbs, moss, or guano, ordnance survey maps (incomplete but
    heavily annotated)...
</p>
<p>
    Environmental hazards are normally detailed on a TAG meant to prime explorers for a specific area. The area
    described might be a room, a corridor, a building, or an entire HOTZONE. Some hazards, such the electrical discharge
    from a damaged circuit, might inflict damage once per interaction; others are cyclical and inflict damage every so
    often while an explorer is in the area. A good Scout knows when to use this skill to soak damage from the
    environment and when to avoid an environment altogether.

<h2>Scout Talents</h2>
<h3>Scavenger (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    Whenever you leave a HOTZONE, you gain one random resource per level of the Scout skill.
</p>
<p>
    The random resource cache is usually in the CRASS command compound; speak to a referee or member of clan command to
    find it.
</p>

<h3>Picklock (1 skill point per level)</h3>
<p>
    May be taken once per level of the Scout skill.</p>
<p>
    This skill allows you to undertake lockpick TASKS; the higher your Picklock, the more complex the lock you can try.
</p>

<h3>Evaluate (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    When inspecting a resource container such as a box, crate, chest, or barrel in the HOTZONE, you may open the
    container to look at its contents without first unlocking it or attempting to disarm any traps that might be
    attached to the container.
</p>
<p>
    This talent does not allow you to take, or interact with, a container's contents; but you may make reasonable
    judgements based on your observations (e.g. "is it worth spending the time to pick this lock?") of the container's
    contents.
</p>

<h3>Applied with a Trowel (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    Warpaint provides you an additional 1 GRIT.
</p>

<h3>Street Sweepers (1 Skill point)</h3>
<p>
    You may use Street Sweeper firearms.
</p>

<h3>Dirty fighting (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    If you strike a target who is "down" (i.e. their stomach or both shoulderblades are touching the ground, or their
    feet are not flat on the floor) with a weapon shorter than 24", you may spend 1 GRIT to call <em>"MAIM"</em> and
    inflict 1 grievous harm on them. You may use this ability twice per day.
