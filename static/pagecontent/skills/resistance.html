<p>
    You are better adapted to the rigours of the Gritlands than most.
</p>
<p>
    This is the skill to take if you want to brush off environmental hazards in the HOTZONE; it is an invaluable skill
    for Scouts and anyone who thinks they might be in the HOTZONE for longer than they had planned.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if the HOTZONE inflicted 1 point of harm every 5 minutes, you might use this skill to soak that damage
    (without using GRIT, see below) for a few cycles, depending on your skill level, before having to take Consequences
    from staying in the HOTZONE for too long. Alternatively, you might use this skill to safely pass through a field of
    electrical discharge that would otherwise cause you a severe injury.
