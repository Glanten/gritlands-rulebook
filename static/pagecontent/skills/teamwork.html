    Teamwork makes the Pixar work. Many hands make light Broth. A problem shared is annoying. Birds of a feather are
    killed with one stone.
</p>
<p>
    Participating in a TASK requires you to spend GRIT on the TASK at hand (i.e. it is not enough to merely hold a torch
    steady or point at a big red button, you must be contributing to the GRIT cost of the TASK).
</p>

<strong>Level 1</strong>
<p>
    When participating in a TASK with at least 3 total participants, all participants are part of your Group, and you
    are contributing at least 1 GRIT, you may contribute 1 extra point of GRIT for free.
</p>

<strong>Level 2</strong>
<p>
    When participating in a TASK with at least 3 total participants, all participants are part of your Group, and you
    are contributing at least 1 GRIT, you may contribute 2 extra point of GRIT for free.
</p>

<strong>Level 3</strong>
<p>
    When participating in a TASK with at least 3 total participants, all participants are part of your Group, and you
    are contributing at least 1 GRIT, you may contribute 3 extra point of GRIT for free.

    Teamwork Talents
</h2>

<h3>Easy Going (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    Once per day, you may use Teamwork without the requirement to contribute at least 1 GRIT to the TASK at hand.
</p>

<h3>A Broad Church (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    You can use Teamwork even when there are participants involved who are not from your Group; for the purposes of the
    Teamwork skill's restrictions you may ignore a number of participants who are not in your group, up to a maximum of
    your Teamwork level. The ignored participants must, however, be from your clan.
</p>
<p>
    This lets you mix participants from your Group and participants who are not from your group, when using Teamwork so
    long as you are all in the same clan.
</p>

<h3>A Very Broad Church (3 skill points)</h3>
<!-- this reads like it has exactly the same effect as A Broad Church -->
<p>
    Requires A Broad Church.
</p>
<p>
    Your Teamwork skill still can be used if the number of participants that are not from your group is equal to or less
    than your Teamwork skill level. All remaining participants must be from your group.
</p>
<p>
    This Talent cannot be used at the same time as A Broad Church.

    <p>
        Note: when using A broad Church and A very Broad Church each individual with the skill must fulfil the
        requirements for themselves - they are not in any way cumulative.
