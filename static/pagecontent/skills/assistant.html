<h1>Assistant</h1>
<p>
    <strong>Everypony</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In order to survive the Gritlands you have to support and be supported by your friends, family, clan and even the
    coalition. And you're really good at helping others achieve their full potential.
</p>
<p>
    If the skill being used is a professional skill you can only assist if you have the same skill (or a talent that
    counts as that skill) and can only contribute GRIT up to your level in that skill.
</p>

<strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        Once per TASK you can spend up to 1 point of GRIT towards the completion of the TASK on behalf of another
        player, provided only you and they are working on the TASK.
    </li>
</ul>

<strong>Level 2</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        Once per TASK you can spend up to 2 points of GRIT towards the completion of the TASK on behalf of another
        player, provided only you and they are working on the TASK.
    </li>
</ul>

<strong>Level 3</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        Once per TASK you can spend up to 3 points of GRIT towards the completion of the TASK on behalf of another
        player, provided only you and they are working on the TASK.
    </li>
</ul>

    Note: Because Assisstant allows you to spend GRIT on behalf of another character you can assist with a task that has
    a maximum of 1 participant.
