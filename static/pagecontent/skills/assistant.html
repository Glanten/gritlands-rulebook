  In order to survive the Gritlands you have to support and be supported by your friends, family, clan and even the
  coalition. And you're really good at helping others achieve their full potential.
</p>
<p>
  The Assistant skill allows you to spend GRIT on a TASK on behalf of another character, this means you can assist with
  a TASK that would otherwise be limited to a lone participant.
</p>
<p>
  If the skill you are assisting is a Professional skill (e.g. Pharmacology or the Engineering skill), you can only
  assist if you have points in that skill (or a talent that counts as that skill) and can only contribute GRIT up to
  your level in that skill.
</p>

</ul>

<strong>Level 3</strong>
