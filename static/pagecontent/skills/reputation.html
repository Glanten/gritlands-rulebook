    This skill represents your (off-screen) standing within the community; the political and social pressure you can
    bring to bear, and your popularity back home.
</p>
<p>
    This skill may impact how many individuals you can affect with your clan's tradition and the degree to which certain
    skills affect you and others.
</p>
<p>
    Reputation also weights your votes when deciding what to do with esoteric artefacts from the beforetimes, when
    choosing your clan's long-term plans, and when divying up the spoils of a successful HOTZONE delve.
</p>
<p>
    Reputation is a utility skill that makes you a more influential decision-maker between HOTZONES. It also increases
    the limits on clan traditions, allowing more people to restore more GRIT from a single instance of a tradition.
