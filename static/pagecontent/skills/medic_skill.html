<h1>Medic</h1>
<p>
    <strong>Archetype, Professional</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You can patch up and repair all manner of injuries, often for good.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Skill Focus</strong>: A (relatively) clean and well-stocked medical kit; a field hospital setting.
</p>
<p>
    A field hospital can hold four patients at a time. Once a field hospital is at capacity, you'd better hope there are
    more facilities nearby or that someone can provide First Aid to stymie the flow of additional patients.
</p>
<p>
    Medic is the go-to skill to remove physical Consequences (wounds, bleeding, burns, broken bones, etc.) from a
    character, especially the really bad kind of Consequences that threaten their lives. It's restrictive, however, in
    that it requires a field hospital; so if you need a quick fix in a HOTZONE you might want to look to First Aid
    instead. Be aware also that Medic does nothing for Consequences to the psyche, for those you want the Counselling
    and Psychoanalysis skills.
</p>

<strong>Level 1</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        You may spend 1 GRIT and engage in 2 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to treat a Minor (Physical) Consequence.
        This treatment removes the Consequence entirely from the patient. There is no GRIT cost for this skill the first
        time you use it on a given day.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may spend 2 GRIT and engage in 5 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to treat a Moderate (Physical)
        Consequence. This treatment removes the Consequence entirely from the patient.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may spend 3 GRIT and engage in 5 minutes of appropriate roleplaying to treat a Major (Physical)
        Consequence, so long as it has been stabilised. This treatment removes the Consequence entirely from the
        patient.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may spend 3 GRIT and attempt to stabilise a Major (Physical) Consequence with a series of bead-pulls. 3
        successful bead-pulls stabilises the Consequence, whereas 3 unsuccessful bead-pulls worsens the condition to a
        Critical Consequence. You must engage in 1 minute of appropriate roleplaying between each bead-pull.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may spend 3 GRIT and attempt to stabilise a Critical (Physical) Consequence with a series of bead-pulls. 3
        successful bead-pulls stabilises the Consequence, whereas 3 unsuccessful bead-pulls will inflict a Terminal
        condition on the character (at this point their fate is sealed and there is nothing more you can do for them).
        You must engage in 1 minute of appropriate roleplaying between each bead-pull.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may not use this skill to treat your own Consequences.
    </li>
</ul>

<strong>Level 2</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        As level 1 plus:
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain an additional free daily use of this skill to treat Minor (Physical) Consequences.
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain a free daily use of this skill to treat a Moderate (Physical) Consequence.
    </li>
    <li>
        You still may not use this skill to treat your own Consequences.
    </li>
</ul>

<strong>Level 3</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        As level 2 plus:
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain another free daily use of this skill to treat Minor (Physical) Consequences.
    </li>
    <li>
        You gain a second free daily use of this skill to treat a Moderate (Physical) Consequence.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once per day you may perform one of the following actions with the normal time and roleplaying requirements, but
        with no GRIT cost or bead-pull:
        <ul>
            <li>Treat a stabilised Major (Physical) Consequence</li>
            <li>Stabilise a Major (Physical) Consequence</li>
            <li>Stabilise a Critical (Physical) Consequence</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Thou shalt not use this skill to heal your own Consequences.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Medic Talents</h2>

<h3>Physician Heal thyself (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    You may treat your own Minor (Physical) Consequences in the same way as you would treat another character, but the
    base cost of treating your own Consequence is 2 GRIT and you may not use a free daily use of this skill to treat
    yourself.
</p>

<h3>Field Medic (1 skill point)</h3>
<p>
    You can spend 1 point of GRIT per treatment to eschew the need for a field hospital as a Skill Focus.
</p>
<p>
    Even with this talent, bead-pulls without a field hospital will be at disadvantage (draw twice and keep the worse
    result).
</p>
<p>
    If you have the Surgeon talent (see below), you may also attempt surgery without a field hospital, but your
    bead-pulls will be at severe disadvantage (draw three times and keep the worse result).
</p>


<h3>Surgeon (1 skill point)</h3>
<!-- surgery: there is no time or GRIT cost listed with it and no consequence for failing the bead-pull... -->
<!-- proposed text:
<p>
    You may spend X GRIT and attempt to treat a Critical (Physical) Consequence, so long as it has been stabilised,
    with a series of bead-pulls. X successful bead-pulls indicates the surgery has been a success and removes the
    Consequence entirely from the patient. X unsuccessful bead-pulls [does something bad? or do you just keep going until
    you succeed?]. You must engage in 1 minute of appropriate roleplaying between each bead-pull.
</p>
<p>    
    You may attempt surgery in this manner a number of times per day equal to your levels in Medic.
</p>
-->
<p>
    (Medic Level) times per day you can perform surgery on a character suffering from a stabilised CRITICAL
    Consequence.
</p>
<p>
    Surgery can HEAL a Critical Consequence.
</p>
<p>
    Surgery TASKs require a Bead Pull.
</p>
<p>
    <strong style="color: orangered;">Update</strong>: No, you left these out of the original rulebook. We'll send an
    email, upload them to the dropbox and put a copy of them in the pack of every character who has the Surgery skill.
    Essentially it's a cool mini game designed to fill the battle to keep a critical character alive with exciting
    roleplay and tough decision making.
</p>
<!-- surgery needs a few points clarified: how much time and GRIT does it cost to perform? -->


<h3>Steady Hands (1 skill point)</h3>

<h3>Systemic Pathologist (1 skill point)</h3>
