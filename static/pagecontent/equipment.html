<h1>Equipment</h1>
<p>
    Characters can make use of various pieces of equipment. Access and use of this equipment is based on its category:
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Stuff</strong> - is freely available to any character - you need to provide the phys-reps yourself. The only
    Mechanical implications for Stuff is that they may be FOCI - which means that they are props required to make use of
    some Skills or Talents.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Things</strong> - are bits of kit that tend to have game mechanics associated with them. The number of, and
    access to them is controlled. Generally, they provide either a mechanical benefit or a practical real-world benefit
    that we want to limit in order to improve the overall experience for all participants. Often they will be marked or
    require a laminated tag (supplied by the game) to be attached.
