<h1>Armour</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        Armour grants additional GRIT - to benefit from this additional durability, a character must have a talent that
        allows them to use it.
    </p>
    <h2> War Paint</h2>
    <p>
        War Paint is any collection of trinkets, leathers, scrap or heraldry-emblazoned junk that
        matches a character's clan and archetype: it's the difference that makes a difference between life or death.
        Examples include: a NuGov enforcer's brass-buttoned 'interrogation jacket', a Wastelander blackthumb's lucky
        necklace of old spanners and grenade pins or a Knight of the Realm's robes of cultivation. All characters can
        wear War Paint.
    </p>
    <h2>'Eavy Metal</h2>
    <p>
        'Eavy Metal on the other hand is unabashedly clank: it's there to stop an axe, turn aside claws
        and dissuade the cowardly from your path. Only characters who invest in the 'Eavy Metal talent can gain use of
        this level of protection.
