<h1>Armour</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        Armour grants additional GRIT - to benefit from this additional durability, a character must have a talent that
        allows them to use it.

    <h2> War Paint</h2>
    <p>
        War Paint is any collection of trinkets, leathers, scrap or heraldry-emblazoned junk that
        matches a character's clan and archetype: it's the difference that makes a difference between life or death.
        Examples include: a NuGov enforcer's brass-buttoned 'interrogation jacket', a Wastelander blackthumb's lucky
        necklace of old spanners and grenade pins or a Knight of the Realm's robes of cultivation. All characters can
        wear War Paint.
    </p>
    <p>
        As per the <strong>...& Chewing Gum</strong> "War Paint" Talent, wearing War Paint provides your character with
        an additional 2 points of GRIT.

    <h2>'Eavy Metal</h2>
    <p>
        'Eavy Metal on the other hand is unabashedly clank: it's there to stop an axe, turn aside claws
        and dissuade the cowardly from your path.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only characters who invest in the 'Eavy Metal Talent (from the D-Fens Skill) can gain use of this level of
        protection.
