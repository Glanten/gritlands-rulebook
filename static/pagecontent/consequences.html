<h1>Consequences</h1>
<p>
    Every character starts with the following Consequence Track. This can be modified by Skills and Talents.
</p>
<div>
    <table class="consequence_track">
        <tr>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>0</strong></td>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>1</strong></td>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>2</strong></td>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>3</strong></td>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>4</strong></td>
            <td class="no_border"><strong>0</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="no_border">Healthy</td>
            <td class="no_border">Minor</td>
            <td class="no_border">Moderate</td>
            <td class="no_border">Major</td>
            <td class="no_border">Critical</td>
            <td class="no_border">Terminal</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<p>
    Note that Consequences can be Physical or Psyche (and there might be other, more unusual types of Consequence out
    there too), which can be an important distinction when certain skills are interacting with them.

<div class="chargen_content" id="consequences_more">

    <p>
        The consequence track has 2 dimensions:
    </p>
    <p>
        The first is the length of the track - the number of spaces (slots) that it contains.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second is the intensity of each slot. These escalate as you move along the track from no consequences
        heading towards the negative end of the track which indicates character death.
    </p>

    <h3>HARM and CONSEQUENCES</h3>
    <p>
        As the name implies, the Consequence Track is used to monitor the consequences your character is suffering from.
        Before we talk about consequences, we need to understand where they come from.
    </p>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Harm describes the things that can hurt you.
        </li>
        <li>
            Harm can come from a variety of sources; close combat hits, firearms shots, radiation, the nineties, poison
            gas, terrifying and horrifying experiences.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the Gritlands your ability to resist avoid and overcome harm comes from a variety of source, tenacity,
            luck, cunning and physical resilience.
        </li>
        <li>
            HARM is damage inflicted on your character.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whenever HARM is inflicted you may choose to spend a point of GRIT to soak the damage and ignore it.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you don't spend GRIT then you take a CONSEQUENCE.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can choose not to spend a point of GRIT in a TASK and take (psyche) HARM instead.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some forms of Damage are GRIEVOUS HARM. You cannot spend grit to avoid consequences from GRIEVOUS HARM.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Source of the HARM generally determines the Type of Consequence.
        </li>
        <li>
            The characters Consequence Track determines the Severity.
        </li>
        <li>
            More Severe Consequences last longer, impair your character more, and may worsen, require treatment and,
            ultimately kill your character dead.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sources of HARM</h4>
    <p>
        The source or cause of the harm flavours its impact on the character, and its potential long term effects.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Source</th>
            <th>Type</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Combat, firearms, torture</td>
            <td>Physical</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Fear, stress, terror, BLITs, torture</td>
            <td>Psyche</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Radiation, nanites, BLITs, poison</td>
            <td>Systemic</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        <strong>Physical</strong>: This covers combat damage, over exertion, sprains, breaks, impact damage and other
        physical trauma. This can be treated with the First aid, Medic and Surgeon skills, and a variety of chemicals
        and devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Psyche</strong>: this covers stress, anxiety and psychological harm caused by fear, terror, horror,
        torture, Some chemical effects and some other rare attacks. Treatment is through Counselling, Psychoanalysis,
        shock therapy and some chemicals and devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Systemic</strong>: This covers the broad spectrum damage wrought internally to organs, systems and DNA
        by Radiation, Poison, Gas, Nanites, Disease and Infection. This can be treated with First Aid, Medicine and a
        variety of Chemicals and Devices
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Exotic/other</strong>: very, very occasionally there may be other forms of HARM. These will be fully
        briefed to players when they encounter them.
    </p>

    <h3>Suffering Consequences</h3>
    <p>
        If you do not absorb the HARM by spending GRIT (or using appropriate skills or equipment), then you suffer a
        consequence.
    </p>
    <h4>Severity</h4>
    <p>
        Each Consequence fills one of the slots on the Characters Consequence Track. The player is usually going to want
        to select the lowest open spot but if you do get shotguned in the chest at point blank range feel free to play
        on hard mode and go straight to Major. The Slot determines the Severity.
    </p>
    <p>
        The severity determines the impact of the Consequence - which effects your mobility, combat ability and skill
        use as defined in the following table. It also effects the recovery and deterioration times.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Consequence Type</th>
            <th>Deterioration</th>
            <th>Requires medical attention</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Minor</td>
            <td>Does not deteriorate</td>
            <td>Requires medical attention</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Moderate</td>
            <td>Does not deteriorate</td>
            <td>4 hours</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Major</td>
            <td>1 hour (if not stabilised)</td>
            <td>8 hours (once stabilised)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Critical</td>
            <td>1 hour (if not stabilised)</td>
            <td>Recovers at the end of the event (if stabilised)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Terminal</td>
            <td>Character dies at end of day (or before)</td>
            <td>Does not recover</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h4>Recovery</h4>
    <p>
        <s>
            Minor Consequences recover unaided after 10 minutes. The space on the track is emptied and the next
            consequence
            can be assigned there.
        </s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>
            Moderate Consequence recover unaided after 4 hours. The space on the track is emptied and the next
            consequence
            can be assigned there.
        </s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong style="color: orangered;">Update</strong>: Minor and Moderate Consequences do not recover without the
        use of the <strong>Medic</strong> skill; the roleplaying effects of Consequences may be mitigated by the
        <strong>First Aid</strong> skill.
    </p>
    <p>
        Major consequences recover unaided after 8 hours, once they have been stabilised.
    </p>
    <p>
        Critical Consequences do not recover on their own.
    </p>
    <h4>Deterioration</h4>
    <p>
        Major Consequences worsen after 1 hour (unless stabilised). When they worsen they inflict a Critical
        Consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Critical Consequences worsen after 1 hours (unless treated). When the worsen they inflict a Terminal
        Consequence.
    </p>
    <h4>This is the end, my friend</h4>
    <p>
        A Terminal Consequence cannot be treated. The character dies at the end of the day, or earlier as the player
        decides.
    </p>

    <h3>Mechanical Penalties</h3>
    <p>
        Having your consequence slots filled makes you less good at stuff and gives the following mechanical
        disadvantages:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Consequence Type</th>
            <th>Skill Penalty</th>

        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Portraying Consequences</h3>
    <p>
        When taking a consequence the most important thing is to adhere to the spirit of the Limitations imposed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Players are encouraged to put a dramatic and appropriate role-play spin on Consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rather than produce a ludicrously large table of effects like a mid 90s TTRPG here is some guidance on how you
        could represent the effects of some Physical CONSEQUNCES based on the location that got hit. Go forth and
        roleplay.

    <h3>Advanced Consequence Theory</h3>
    <p>
        The entire point of consequences is to encourage cool, dramatic, varied injuries and reactions to the horrors of
        the Gritlands. To specifically avoid "I've been hit x times in a given location it stops working" or "I'm at
        zero I fall over".
    </p>
    <p>
        In the vast majority of cases the Type of consequences you take should be linked to the source of the damage.
        But occasionally it is fine to mix this up:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You might choose to take a point of physical HARM as a mental consequence to represent the fact that the
            physical wound is not as debilitating to your character as the fear and panic that being shot causes them.
        </li>
        <li>
            In different circumstances you might decide to represent the impact to Mental HARM caused by a terrifying
            monster through nausea rather than panic - as your body has a physiological reaction to the surge in stress
            hormones and adrenaline.
        </li>
        <li>
            Similarly if poisoned you might take a mental or system consequence to represent a mania, or sickness
            inflicted by the chemicals.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Generally such swapping of consequences should be reserved for Minor and Moderate Consequences only.
    </p>
    <p>
        Major, and Definitely Critical Consequences should follow directly from the source of HARM.
    </p>
    <h4>Alternative Consequence Examples</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Blind</strong>: Best suited to Physical / Systemic and Chemical sources of HARM.
    </p>
    <p>
        You go blind. You should close your eyes (opening them only to allow you to move safely if you are on uneven
        ground or moving at pace). You can move at any speed but are entirely unable to fight or shoot. You might still
        be able to use certain skills - where there is no requirement to see - and even operate some simple devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a Major Blindness is not stabilised your eyes become infected and you suffer Systemic Critical Consequences -
        Collapsing, screaming in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Reckless</strong>: Best suited to high pressure dangerous situations, and lower level Consequences (say
        minor and moderate)
    </p>
    <p>
        You cannot move away from trouble (this would generally include refusing to leave the HOTZONE unless everyone
        else is leaving too)
    </p>
    <p>
        You can attack, but defend poorly (you most likely discard your shield)
    </p>
    <p>
        You can maintain your rate of fire - but waste every other shot firing into the floor/air
    </p>
