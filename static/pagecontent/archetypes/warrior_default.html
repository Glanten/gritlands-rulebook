    Everyone knows to carry a big stick and conserve ammo for the worst of circumstances. But warriors excel at taking
    and dealing out raw violence. A handy trick in such a brutal, violent world inhabited by monsters, horrors and
    unscrupulous or psychotic survivors who will murder you dead as soon as look at you. They are INVALUABLE - without
    them you stand no chance against the hordes of beings who want to kill you and wear your skin like a dress.
