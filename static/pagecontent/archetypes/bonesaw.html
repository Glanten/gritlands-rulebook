    <strong>Bonesaw</strong>: Some mistake the Wastelander's wasteland
    survival viewpoint to mean that they regard
    the wounded as “weak” and leave them to
    bleed out and die. This is not the case. The
    Wastelanders are like a single organism, and like
    any organism it can be damaged and weakened
    by its trials in the wastes; the difference is that
    the Wastelanders know best how to heal that
    organism and bring it back to full strength, this
    time criss-crossed with hella sweet scar tissue
    and the determination to keep going...
