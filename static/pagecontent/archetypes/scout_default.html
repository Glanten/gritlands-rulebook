    Primarily concerned with assessing and surveying the blasted wasteland, Scouts tend to be tough, stealthy,
    survivors, able to assess the lay of the land, spot and circumvent the many hazards and dangers that the wastes,
    and the Hot Zones throw at them. They are INVALUABLE - without them you will get poisoned, irradiated, ambushed
    or worse.
