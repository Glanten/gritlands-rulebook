    <strong>Bruiser</strong>: For the Wastelanders, combat is just another way that the wasteland tests its inhabitants;
    as a result, almost every Wastelander is ready to shoot, stab, hack, shank, or crush at the drop of a hat. Warriors
    amongst the Wastelanders, then, are those who embrace this element of wasteland survival and proudly bear the scars
    and trophies they've earned during their many trials.
