    <strong>Broadcaster</strong>: If no-one saw you do it, did it even happen? The
    Story Keepers of the Wastelanders are there to
    safeguard the stories of its heroes. As well as
    keeping these great tales of daring-do alive they
    also serve as a vast repository of knowledge;
    which yellow snow not to eat, which wasteland
    fauna make great pillows, how many cactuses Big
    Jim was able to cram in his mouth in one go. They
    are often identified by the tools of their trade,
    microphones and empty screened frames with
    which to broadcast their knowledge to all those
    willing to listen.
