    <strong>Boffin</strong>: After demonstrating their prerequisite skills
    in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and form-
    filling, Nu-Gov Boffins begin their architect
    apprenticeship by attempting to restore an
    unidentified old world artifact. Those who are not
    irradiated, possessed, melted, frozen, blown up,
    shot, or infected by the artefact are permitted
    to go on expeditions with the clan warband.
