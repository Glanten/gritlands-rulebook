    <strong>Quaestor</strong>: Quaestors eschew the beaten steel of the Knight so that they can more easily traverse the Roads and face the wastes in-between. They are tasked in keeping the scattered settlements of the Realm connected - no matter what. Outriders and scouts, the Quaestors are wise in identifying and neutralising the many dangers that lurk just off of the path.
