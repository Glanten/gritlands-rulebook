<h2>Quaestor</h2>
<h3>Knights of the Realm</h3>
<p>
    Quaestors eschew the beaten steel of the Knight so that they can more easily traverse the Roads and face the wastes in-between. They are tasked in keeping the scattered settlements of the Realm connected - no matter what. Outriders and scouts, the Quaestors are wise in identifying and neutralising the many dangers that lurk just off of the path.
