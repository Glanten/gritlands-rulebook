    You need every edge you can get in Hot Zones and Drugs will often be the first, last and most fun way to get that
    edge. But Even then - sometimes - you will get shot, stabbed, beaten and blown up. When this happens you are going
    to need someone to patch you up and make the pain go away. They are INVALUABLE - as a shot of Adreno-Bang might be
    the only thing to get you through, and no one wants to try sewing their own intestines back into their body.
