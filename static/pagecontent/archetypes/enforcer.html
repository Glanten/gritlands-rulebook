    <strong>Enforcer</strong>: To carve civilization from the ruins, one requires tools that are heavy, robust, and
    sharp. NuGov's Enforcers are those tools. Enforcers usually pride themselves on maintaining their weapons and
    equipment. Although mass production has not survived, NuGov enforcers tend to feel better when their gear looks at
    least similar to their fellows'.
