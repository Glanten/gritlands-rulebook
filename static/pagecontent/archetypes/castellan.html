    <strong>Castellan</strong>: Oaths are the lifeblood of the Realm: swearing
    to thwart the evils of wilted rocket, or to cleanse
    the fields of ptero-gulls are how things get done.
    Of course, when hot-zones are involved, the
    dispensing of quests, recovering of relics and
    recording of oaths become even more important.
    Castellans record these oaths and hold those
    that swear them accountable. In addition in an
    age of dangerous leavings from the Old World it
    is they that declare ancient tech either a valuable
    tool to be forged into new ploughshares or
    ground to radioactive dust and cast to the winds
    lest even knowledge of it pollute the innocent
    minds of the new world.
