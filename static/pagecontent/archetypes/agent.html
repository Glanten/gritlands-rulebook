    <strong>Agent</strong>: If there is a job worth doing, it's worth making sure it's been done right and who better to
    make sure a job is done right than a qualified overseer, manager or professional bureaucrat. NuGov's Agents are
    always in the thick of the action, quick to wield pen and clipboard to ensure tasks are completed efficiently, on
    time and only marginally over budget.
