    <strong>Preacher</strong>: When the spirits of the faithful flag in the face of adversity or the unrighteous need a
    thoroughly good telling who better to call on than a proper old school fire and brimstone preacher? Who better to
    spread the good word and blister the souls of the unworthy to bring them into the light? Who better to fill the
    belly of the faithful with burning clarity and drive them onto feats of unattainable glory in the Divine Leader's
    name? No one, that's who.
