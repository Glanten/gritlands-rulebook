    <strong>Blackthumb</strong>: Covered in grease and grime, constantly
    experimenting with mushroom drug cocktails,
    unstable explosive compounds, and cobbled-
    together machinery capable of “accidentally”
    taking your hand off, the Wastelanders'
    engineers are a special kind of mad. Inspired they
    might be, but that inspiration often comes at the
    cost of rational thinking, reasonable limits, and
    safety measures...
