<h2>Scavenger</h2>
<h3>Wastelanders</h3>
<p>
    Of all the clans, the Wastelanders know best the dangers of the wasteland; and amongst the wastelanders, their scouts know best how to endure those dangers. The Wastelanders are nomadic, and they rely on their scavengers not only to identify reliable routes and find suitable shelter, but also to lead the clan to scrap and raw materials that they can trade for food, water, and medicine.
