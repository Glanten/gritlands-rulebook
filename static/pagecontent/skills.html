<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>
    Skills let you interact with the game world in cool ways.
</p>

<h2>Skill Types</h2>
<p>
    Some skills are <em>Archetype Skills</em>: they are an important part of a character archetype.
</p>
<p>
    Some skills are <em>Professional Skills</em>: they require specialist training and are more restrictive than other
    skills. These restrictions usually come into play when one character tries to assist another in a given TASK.
</p>
<p>
    Other skills are <em>Everypony Skills</em>: these are available to everyone and have fewer restrictions.
</p>

<h2>Skill Focus</h2>
<p>
    Some skills require a Focus, a prop or physrep that you can toy with during your roleplaying to demonstrate your use
    of that skill. If a skill lists a focus and you do not have one, you cannot use that skill. Some skills that require
    a focus will let you use a skill without one, but this will be clearly stated in the skill's description and your
    character normally suffers a significant penalty to their actions while they lack an appropriate focus.
</p>

<h2>Skills and TAGS & TASKS</h2>
<p>
    Some TAGS and TASKS have a minimum skill level required before they can be interacted with.
</p>
<p>
    For example: some old, worn machinery deep in a HOTZONE might require Engineering to fix, or a set of unfamiliar
    tracks might require the Scouting skill to identify.
</p>
<p>
    The TAG or TASK should specify the minimum skill level required to interact with the tagged item.
</p>

<h2>Talents</h2>
<p>
    If you have a Skill at level 1 or higher, you can spend further skill points to acquire Talents associated with that
    Skill. Some Talents have prerequisites which must be met before they are bought, and each Talent can only be bought
    once (unless stated otherwise).
