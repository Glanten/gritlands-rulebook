<h1>Engineer</h1>

    If drugs give you the edge then the rest of the shape is made up of your gear. Without it you might as well not
    leave the safety of the enclaves. Not that there would be enclaves without engineers - they keep everything running
    in good order and use their ingenuity and opposable thumbs to solve problems that would otherwise be beyond the
    abilities of anyone. They are INVALUABLE - as you are worse than toast without decent gear.
